To win Hungary’s approval, European leaders agreed to allow pipeline imports. |  | Five European countries import Russian oil by pipeline. Germany and Poland agreed to cut off all Russian imports, including those arriving by pipeline, by the end of the year, but Hungary, Slovakia and the Czech Republic made no such pledge. The three countries are very dependent on Russian oil imports, but Slovakia and the Czech Republic have already indicated that they were working toward switching their supply away from Russia."

A political allegory, a savage drag show and a folie à deux with far too much gunplay for anyone who has lived through the past week’s news, “Notes” is a trigger warning writ large and in glitter, a fever dream with streamers. |  | For those who don’t follow Puerto Rico’s political and economic fortunes, a brief history lesson will prove useful. By 2016, Puerto Rico’s credit crisis had worsened significantly, with the island owing more than $70 billion. In a move with celebrity backing — Lin-Manuel Miranda was at the time a supporter — Congress passed the Puerto Rican Oversight, Management and Economic Stability Act, known as Promesa, which gave an unelected board the power to restructure the island’s debt and impose fiscal austerity. Few of that board’s members lived in Puerto Rico, which added to criticism of the act as colonialist. |  | These circumstances have brought Lolita (Christine Carmela), a trans Puerto Rican woman, to the New York City offices of the Promesa board, with a gun in her purse. Lolita is not her real name, but she has styled herself, she tells us, after Lolita Lebrón, a Puerto Rican nationalist who participated in an armed attack on the House of Representatives in 1954. That attack wounded five members of Congress; our Lolita aims for a greater body count. Yet before she can assassinate anyone, a receptionist (Samora la Perdida) intercepts her and takes her firearm away."

The theme entries are all things that you might need a pin to use — or, as the revealer suggests about each of them, LET’S PUT A PIN IN IT (“Suggestion to defer discussion … and what might be said of 17-, 25-, 46- and 60-Across”). This is a fun phrase that the constructors interpret literally, relying on several meanings of the word PIN. |  | First, at 17A, we have VOODOO DOLL. To take just a brief detour, I have heard from solvers who were (rightly!) concerned about the misrepresentation of VOODOO or hoodoo in previous crossword puzzles. I did a little more reading to understand how we got it wrong, and I think this entry and clue (“Figure in many hexes”) are also problematic. VOODOO as a practiced religion has been reduced to racialized pop culture tropes (like sticking pins in a VOODOO DOLL, which is not actually a component of the religion). I think the New York Times Crossword can do better about this. |  | The rest of the theme entries are also not without controversy. I predict an avalanche of comments from solvers about the theme entry at 60A, A.T.M. MACHINE. As any pedant can tell you, the M of A.T.M. stands for MACHINE, so this entry could be read as AUTOMATED TELLER MACHINE MACHINE. I am not troubled by this particular entry because I think A.T.M. MACHINE is very much in-the-language, but I suspect many crossword solvers (whom I would never accuse of being pedantic types!) are going to have some choice words about it. |  | The other two theme entries are CLOTH DIAPER at 25A (“Alternative to Huggies or Luvs”) and BOWLING LANE (“Place for splits and spares”). Both are definitely things you could put a PIN (or several PINs) in. Let’s hear from Mr. Buchbinder and Mr. Wilber. |  | Constructor Notes |  | Brad Wilber (writing for the team): Sam and I have been published as a team elsewhere, but I’m proud to be part of his first collaboration in The Times. I feel enriched by working with someone of his talent, and also by having some glimpses into his life as a history teacher and a dad, since my late father taught high school social studies. Having this puzzle reach print is especially satisfying because there were so many levels of decision-making for us. Since we ended up with drafts at two different word counts, did the additional black square help or hurt our chances? Should the revealer be a grid-spanner, or something shorter like “PUT A PIN IN (IT)”? If we kept to the most obvious definition of pin, would the tautness be congratulated, or would the editorial team respond more positively to a variety of pins? When Sam proposed we flesh out this idea together, he had a worksheet with many senses of “pin.” Ultimately, we submitted a version set entirely in the realm of pins as fasteners, so when Will asked us to revise the bottom half of the puzzle and swap in BOWLING LANE and A.T.M. MACHINE for our originals, we had to laugh at the déjà vu. |  | Want to Submit Crosswords to The New York Times? |  | The New York Times Crossword has an open submission system, and you can submit your puzzles online. |  |  |  | For tips on how to get started, read our series, “How to Make a Crossword Puzzle.” |  | The Tipping Point |  | Almost finished solving but need a bit more help?

Biden Jr. |  | The lawyers named in the subpoena included Mr. Trump’s personal attorney, Rudolph W. Giuliani; Jenna Ellis, who worked with Mr. Giuliani; John Eastman, one of the former president’s chief legal advisers during the postelection period; and Kenneth Chesebro, who wrote a pair of memos laying out the details of the plan. |  | Those subpoenas also requested information about any members of the Trump campaign who may been involved with the alternate elector scheme and about several Republican officials in Georgia who took part in it, including David Shafer, the chairman of the Georgia Republican Party. |  | Mr. Navarro’s subpoena, by his own account, was issued by a different grand jury. |  | In the draft of the suit he said he intends to file, he argues that only Mr. Trump can authorize him to testify. He asks a judge to instruct Mr. Graves, the U.S. attorney in Washington, to negotiate his appearance with Mr. Trump. Mr. Navarro cites Mr. Trump’s invocation of executive privilege over materials related to the attack on the Capitol. |  | “The executive privilege invoked by President Trump is not mine or Joe Biden’s to waive,” Mr. Navarro writes. “Rather, as with the committee, the U.S. attorney has constitutional and due process obligations to negotiate my appearance.”"

Si hay una mayor capacidad para realizar pruebas de viruela del mono en el país, las autoridades de salud pública podrán intervenir y desacelerar la posible diseminación del brote. |  | Los CDC deberían dar a conocer de manera generalizada la información sobre sus protocolos de prueba de viruela del mono para que más laboratorios puedan desarrollar y realizar sus propias pruebas de detección de esta enfermedad. La FDA también debería ofrecerles orientación a todos los laboratorios autorizados para realizar pruebas de laboratorio complejas y aclarar qué tipo de facultad regulatoria, en su caso, implementarían sobre las pruebas de detección de viruela del mono desarrolladas por otras partes. |  | Los CDC establecen que cualquier departamento de salud estatal que confirme que un paciente tiene un orthopoxvirus debe asumir que la persona tiene viruela del mono y proceder de inmediato a aplicar medidas de contención, como el rastreo de contactos. La agencia también afirma que mantiene monitoreado el número de equipos de prueba disponibles en caso de que sea necesario incrementarlo. |  | Por fortuna, hay vacunas contra la viruela del mono y un antiviral autorizado por la FDA, que están listos en la Reserva Estratégica Nacional. Es esencial darles prioridad a las personas en riesgo inmediato de contraer la viruela del mono, como aquellas con algún contacto cercano reciente. Vacunar a quienes no han estado expuestos —práctica llamada vacunación en anillo— puede evitar que continúe la propagación. También debe considerarse la vacunación proactiva de quienes están en mayor riesgo. Para activar estas medidas, así como el despliegue efectivo de antivirales, es necesario el diagnóstico rápido de casos, por lo que las pruebas deberían tener carácter prioritario, junto con la vacunación. |  | Incluso si continúan los casos entre hombres que tienen relaciones sexuales con otros hombres, con seguridad no seremos los únicos que se enfermen. Las epidemias de enfermedades infecciosas están determinadas por el patrón y la frecuencia del contacto entre las personas, así como el patógeno y la inmunidad y susceptibilidad de la población. La COVID-19 nos enseñó que las epidemias son impredecibles, y la salud de los seres humanos tiene conexiones globales: las variantes y los virus que surgen en un país pueden con facilidad cruzar fronteras y llegar a otro. |  | En nuestra comunidad de personas queer podemos crear conciencia sobre la posible presencia de una nueva enfermedad, al igual que muchas otras infecciones comunes. En el pasado, compartir lo que sabemos sobre nuestra salud y las opciones para intervenir con servicios libres de estigmas nos ha permitido guiar a nuestros médicos y comunidades. Cuando comenzaron a presentarse brotes de meningitis bacteriana en comunidades gays, las autoridades sanitarias ofrecieron vacunas en sitios de vida nocturna activa y lugares donde los hombres se reunían para tener relaciones sexuales. Debemos aprovechar la proximidad del verano y las festividades del Orgullo LGBT para poner en marcha iniciativas similares y ayudar a mantenernos seguros. |  | Las autoridades de salud pública deben desarrollar e implementar una estrategia de realización de pruebas y vacunación centrada en las comunidades con más probabilidades de resultar afectadas. Si, por ejemplo, las pruebas y la información dirigida a la comunidad se concentran solo en las ciudades principales, podrían acentuarse las desigualdades sanitarias por raza, clase y ubicación geográfica. No podemos permitir que la viruela del mono se convierta en una enfermedad de quienes no tienen acceso a los servicios de salud."

Ese porcentaje se redujo durante los siguientes días, pero un estimado de un 20 por ciento siguió dando positivo el décimo primer día, de acuerdo con el estudio, que todavía no ha sido publicado en una revista científica. |  | “Algunas personas están viendo que dan positivo con la prueba antígeno durante periodos bastante prolongados”, comentó Grad. “Creo que se lo atribuimos a una variación en el sistema inmunitario de la gente y la capacidad de responder frente a una infección y eliminar este virus”. |  | En efecto, un par de estudios recientes, ninguno de los cuales ha sido revisado por expertos, sugieren que algunas personas con infecciones de la ómicron expulsan virus infecciosos —capaces de replicarse en un “cultivo celular” o un recipiente de células vivas en el laboratorio— durante más de una semana."

In 1976, his scout troop raised the flag over Lexington Green at the start of the Bicentennial celebration. As he says, “I came by my patriotism honestly.” |  | But much later in life this story takes on a different meaning to McKibben. He laments that some of the New England revolutionaries were slaveholders. There was a place name not far from his old neighborhood where a rebellious enslaved man was hanged and tarred, his body displayed in an iron cage as a warning. McKibben is greatly influenced, as well, by Nikole Hannah-Jones’s 1619 Project, which seeks to reframe American history by putting slavery at the center of the narrative. McKibben does note that many historians took issue with Hannah-Jones’s original contention that one of the main reasons the colonists went to war was to protect slavery. (The phrasing was later changed to “some of the colonists.”) |  | No matter. McKibben has shed his long-held view of America’s founding. “Because let’s be real: Right now all that talk about equality, and farmers standing up to kings, and so on — the talk that was so appealing to me when I was a guide, and which still stirs me when I read it — is hard to take seriously in a country that has turned out as unequal as the one in which we live.” |  | Of course, you could argue that flawed people still produce lasting change for the betterment of humanity, a pattern for much of history. Behind the stirring words of many a brave and enlightened soul is someone doing something dastardly. What matters is the longevity of the ideas. |  | For McKibben, one revisionist view led to another. “Once the thread tugging begins, of course, it continues; that is its nature, and before long your warm and cozy sweater is full of raveling holes.”"

He was much criticized for these assumptions in his earlier book, and here too he asserts the connections without tracing the explicit links and influences through the years of the mid-19th century and beyond. |  | But for all the parallels between the two studies, 2022 is not 1989. In the era of “The 1619 Project” and of right-wing attacks on what is characterized as critical race theory, African American history poses different challenges and questions than did a study of British folkways. Fischer assails what he sees as a “deeply negative” turn in historical writing in the 21st century, as well as a “cultivated carelessness of fact and evidence.” He insists that his study will be an “open-ended inquiry,” not “an argument or a thesis or a polemic.” |  | Yet his book, as its subtitle indicates, is clearly an argument: “How Enslaved People Expanded American Ideals.” He is intent to show, in a phrase he repeats often, that Africans “made a difference” in American history, and that they “continue to make a profound difference in our world.” He does not ignore or minimize the brutality, cruelty and injustice of slavery and racism, but this is nonetheless a celebratory narrative that belies his declaration in the introduction that he “does not begin with predominantly positive or negative judgments about the main lines of American history.” |  | “African Founders” is fundamentally an appreciation of the place of Black people in America past and present, as well as an appreciation of the nation of which they became a part. Their “creativity” — he uses the words “creative” or “creativity” over 100 times in the book — combined African characteristics with the customs of the peoples and societies among which they found themselves to make signal contributions to a syncretic American culture. For each region he outlines this process, summarizing in his conclusion four distinctive African “gifts” to American life: language and speech, music, spirit and soul, and ethics and freedom. The very word “gift” — which also makes frequent appearances in his text — may offer a hint about the difficulties inherent in this approach. “Gift” indicates something that is freely given, not something seized from one who is in bondage. And at the same time, it suggests something that is less than essential or formative: a contribution or an add-on rather than a foundation. |  | Yet Fischer has titled his book “African Founders,” a term that resonates within our national history and mythology with its implications of defining and enduring influence. He argues that in struggling for their own freedom, Black people expanded and transformed America’s understanding of what freedom meant. The presence of enslaved Africans and their descendants, he suggests, has made us freer than we would otherwise be. Does that describe us today? Is not the exact opposite the case? How do we explain why the United States has incarcerated the highest percentage of its population of any country in the world, with Black men imprisoned at more than five times the rate of white men? Persisting racism and the inequality and injustice it yields continue to make us less free in spite of the centuries of struggle Fischer venerates. As he acknowledges, good history does indeed require us to go beyond both celebration and condemnation. Perhaps the debate his new book is likely to generate can help move us toward that goal."
nytimes,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/05/31/opinion/supreme-court-heller-guns.html,2022-05-31T00:00:00,"Kate believes that Justice Stevens’s dissent in Heller provided a better account of both the text and history of the Second Amendment and that in any event, the method of historical inquiry the majority prescribes should lead to the court upholding most gun safety measures, including the New York law pending before the Supreme Court. John believes that Heller correctly construed the original meaning of the Second Amendment and is one of the most important decisions in U.S. history. We disagree about whether Heller should be extended to protect citizens who wish to carry firearms outside the home for self-defense and, if so, how states may regulate that activity — issues that the Supreme Court is set to decide in the New York case in the next month or so. |  | But despite our fundamental disagreements, we are both concerned that Heller has been misused in important policy debates about our nation’s gun laws. In the 14 years since the Heller decision, Congress has not enacted significant new laws regulating firearms, despite progressives’ calls for such measures in the wake of mass shootings. Many politicians cite Heller as the reason. But they are wrong. |  | Heller does not totally disable government from passing laws that seek to prevent the kind of atrocities we saw in Uvalde, Texas. And we believe that politicians on both sides of the aisle have (intentionally or not) misconstrued Heller. Some progressives, for example, have blamed the Second Amendment, Heller or the Supreme Court for mass shootings. And some conservatives have justified contested policy positions merely by pointing to Heller, as if the opinion resolved the issues. |  | Neither is fair. Rather, we think it’s clear that every member of the court on which we clerked joined an opinion, either majority or dissent, that agreed that the Constitution leaves elected officials an array of policy options when it comes to gun regulation. |  | Justice Scalia — the foremost proponent of originalism, who throughout his tenure stressed the limited role of courts in difficult policy debates — could not have been clearer in the closing passage of Heller that “the problem of handgun violence in this country” is serious and that the Constitution leaves the government with “a variety of tools for combating that problem, including some measures regulating handguns.” Heller merely established the constitutional baseline that the government may not disarm citizens in their homes. The opinion expressly recognized “presumptively lawful” regulations such as “laws imposing conditions and qualifications on the commercial sale of arms,” as well as bans on carrying weapons in “sensitive places,” like schools, and it noted with approval the “historical tradition of prohibiting the carrying of ‘dangerous and unusual weapons.’” Heller also recognized the immense public interest in “prohibitions on the possession of firearms by felons and the mentally ill.”"

Lopez, who before his death at 75 had traveled to more and stranger corners of the earth than most of us have bothered to imagine, certainly understood it as such. “To read the newspapers today, to merely answer the phone,” he wrote elsewhere, “is to know the world is in flames.” So perhaps his request is better read as a challenge — not only to readers but also to himself, a writer who, as long as he can keep our attention, holds our souls in his hands. |  | Lopez did not take the task of writing lightly. The books for which he is still best known — “Of Wolves and Men” (1978) and “Arctic Dreams” (1986) — are works of extraordinary immersive rigor, imaginative breadth and intellectual depth. He published novels, short stories, a memoir of sorts and countless essays, both substantial and ephemeral. In one of the 27 essays that are collected here, he tries to pin down the point of it all: “The central project of my adult life as a writer,” he says, “is to know and love what we have been given, and to urge others to do the same.” |  | Throughout this book, Lopez considers his calling in terms that are unabashedly spiritual. Raised a Catholic, he was “fixated” in high school, he wrote, on emulating the life of the Jesuit paleontologist and theologian Pierre Teilhard de Chardin. Even after drifting away from Catholicism, he took time off from a New York publishing job for a retreat at the Kentucky abbey where the mystic and writer Thomas Merton lived. Fortunately for us, he didn’t stay. But years later, Lopez still relied “on the centrality of a life of prayer, which I broadly took to be a continuous, respectful attendance to the presence of the Divine. Prayer was one’s daily effort to be incorporated within that essence.” |  | That is a definition broad enough to include the act of writing, especially if your sentences shimmer and punch as magnificently and as hard as Lopez’s do. Lopez focused much of his respectful attendance on the land itself: this earth and the manifold forms of life that teem upon it. In one of the best essays in the collection, and one of the finest pieces of writing about Los Angeles that I have read, Lopez recalls a bucolic childhood in Reseda, a San Fernando Valley neighborhood that is now synonymous with dense suburbia but that in the 1950s was mainly farmland. The essay is in part a history, from the genocidal arrival of whites in the Valley to the whiplash suburbanization of the postwar boom. (He describes the latter as like “watching something emphatic move across the land, implacable, unfolding like the flaps of a cardboard box.”)"
nytimes,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/05/31/opinion/ezra-klein-podcast-erika-bachiochi.html,2022-05-31T00:00:00,"ezra klein |  | I’m Ezra Klein. This is “The Ezra Klein Show.” [THEME MUSIC] One question I’ve been thinking about during this series on the rising right is whether the balance of power in the Republican Party is shifting. For years, social conservatives provided the G.O.P. its votes and its shock troops. But the economic conservatives got all the policy. Republicans would win by mobilizing evangelicals and then use that power to pass corporate tax cuts. But it feels like we may be at an inflection point. The multidecade effort to stack the Supreme Court with hardcore social conservatives is paying off. Roe looks like it’s going to be overturned. And beyond that, if you look at the new generation of right wing politicians, like Josh Hawley and Ron DeSantis and JD Vance, you see that economic policy is really up for debate. This is a different party than the Paul Ryan Republican Party. But it’s social policy where the clear lines are being drawn. There’s a very widespread view among this cohort and the thinkers are drawing on that Republican politicians of recent years put markets first and families and churches and communities last. And the result has been social disintegration and cultural chaos. But I think it’s fair to say the critique is far ahead of the policy agenda right now. I think you saw this a bit in the Patrick Deneen episode from a few weeks back. You get this very strident populism that sometimes seems to resolve down into almost generic center-left policy ideas, get these slashing social critiques that end in a shrug about what is to be done. But that’s not going to be good enough for long. If Roe is indeed overturned, the Republican Party in general and social conservatives in particular are going to be the dogs that caught the car. Most Americans don’t want abortion banned. And the right will need some answer for them, some way to show that they are pro-family, even pro-women, not just anti-abortion, that they have an answer to the struggles families face that goes beyond removing reproductive choice and attacking liberals. One place they might look for that more holistic vision is in the work of Erika Bachiochi. Bachiochi is a legal scholar at the Conservative Ethics and Public Policy Center and the director of the Wollstonecraft Project at the Abigail Adams Institute. And in her 2021 book “The Rights of Women: Reclaiming a Lost Vision,” she tries to build a structure, a philosophical structure, going back to older thinkers, for a socially conservative feminism, one that embraces women’s gains in professional and civic life but holds that abortion and technological forms of contraception and the sexual revolution were devastating for women’s well-being and the cultivation of virtue and duty. She connects this broader critique that Republicans for too long have put markets first and families last. Her view is that abortion and contraception — and you’ll hear this — really serve the needs of capital at the expense of families. And with Roe gone, Bachiochi believes that a truly pro-family conservatism and even country can flourish. And so I wanted to have her on to draw out the story she’s telling and the conservatives are increasingly trying to tell and try to understand whether it holds up and what kind of agenda it drives. As always, my email — ezrakleinshow@nytimes.com. Erika Bachiochi, welcome to the show. |  | erika bachiochi |  | Thanks for having me, Ezra. |  | ezra klein |  | So you say that the gender revolution has, quote, “stalled.” Tell me why. |  | erika bachiochi |  | Ooh, that’s a big question. In “The Rights of Women,” I tell the story of the cause of women’s rights through the lens of sexual and reproductive asymmetry. I think for a long time in the 1980s — and then still you hear this in different circles, that the real question of feminism is, are women and men the same, or are women and men different? And I don’t really think that’s that difficult of a question. I think there’s many ways in which we’re the same and many ways in which we’re different. And we can talk certainly about what those are. But it seems to me that the question of sexual and reproductive asymmetry, the fact that men and women engage in the same sexual act in heterosexual sex but that women can get pregnant and men cannot, is really the one that all feminists are responding to in their different kind of ways. And so I think we’ve seen women advance in so many ways, except there isn’t this concomitant valuing of the work that’s done by women in pregnancy and then the work that’s done by both men and women in the home. And so we tend to, I think, see the modern day women’s movement really capitulate to a market logic, where equality is seen in market terms, a market equality, where instead of this women as caregivers and men as breadwinners, both men and women are valued only as breadwinners. And that really important work of care that women especially but increasingly, generationally speaking, men too really value, that work of care they do in the home, has not been valued in the market and by our public institutions. And that has been especially, I think, difficult for poor women. |  | ezra klein |  | So I’m in very deep agreement that a profound problem in our society is that we don’t value care work. And in the book, you’re drawing a fairly deep connection between the rise of contraception, abortion rights, and Roe particularly, the change in our sexual culture, the rise of single parenthood to that devaluing or lack of valuing of care work. And that’s where I want to try to understand the causal chain a bit better. You’re making a causal claim that contraception and abortion create this dominance of market logic, this devaluing of the family and — I think you’re making this claim — lead women to be worse off. And so first, is that a fair read of the argument, that you think this has made women worse off? |  | erika bachiochi |  | Well, I think you could say that in some ways, if you were just counting economic measures, you would say that elite women are better off, right? So elite women use contraception quite effectively. They still tend to have children within marriage, which tends to be much better for them in terms of their own balance between caregiving and work outside the home. And I think there’s ways in which it hasn’t been good for elite women. The other part that’s, I think, real male normative is the way in which the casual sex culture has become sort of the default. And I think that tends to be better for a male sexuality. Now, it’s not to say that there aren’t alpha women who like sex on the first date or the first meeting. But all sorts of data shows us that women tend to prefer sex and actually enjoy sex much more in commitment. So in that way, elite women aren’t better off. I think all in all, poor women are worse off. The abortion-backed contraceptive revolution has allowed men especially to basically — gives them more reason to walk away from unexpected pregnancy. And so when poor women choose to have their children, which they tend to do in larger numbers when those children are unexpected than wealthy women do and educated women do, they’re bereft of the paternal support they need, both emotional support for their own children, for themselves in the difficult work of caregiving, but also especially financial support. And I think that’s led to a feminization of poverty. This isn’t just me saying it but a lot of what I call sexual economics, George Akerlof, Janet Yellen’s work, and others, who have really pointed to the way in which the pill has really been an instigator in this technological shock that has created more single motherhood. And what do we see but single motherhood is the single greatest predictor of poverty in our country? And it’s not just financial poverty but a real difficulty, the kind of stress that single mothers have on them in raising children without paternal support, without men in their lives. And we can point to all sorts of ways in which our current economy and economic transitions have harmed men and made them incapable of being there. And that’s certainly a tangled web — greater incarceration rates and all sorts of things like that. And I think a pretty good argument can be made, at least I try to make it, that disconnecting and decoupling sex from marriage and marriage from childbearing is pretty devastating for the poor. |  | ezra klein |  | So I want to put a pin in the question of poverty, because we’re definitely going to come back to that. But let’s take this at the different sequential layers of the question. And so let’s begin with the changes you identify in America’s and probably broadly Western, even global sexual culture, driven certainly in part by technologies like the pill. And let me ask the question this way. What for you is the role of pleasure in thinking about when sex is ethical and virtuous and desirable? |  | erika bachiochi |  | Yeah, no, I think that that’s an important question in the sense that it seems to me that the way sex, as thought about today, is very much self-expression, is very much pleasure in mind. And I think, again, there are pretty dangerous asymmetries for women there. Because when you decouple sex from marriage and from childbearing and pleasure is left to be the only marker, that it tends to be far better for men. And let me lay that out a bit more. I mean, I think pleasure is a great side effect, we could say, to sex. I think it’s great when sex is pleasurable. But as it turns out, for women, sex is far more pleasurable in commitment. And why in commitment? Because for sex to be pleasurable for women, there needs to be kind of a vulnerability, where a woman is relaxed enough to enjoy sex. And her partner needs to really take interest in her sexual pleasure. And that doesn’t generally come in the hookup culture. Christine Emba’s new book — I think it’s called “Rethinking Sex: A Provocation” — she, I think, in there has some data about the real orgasm gap that you see in the casual sex culture today. So I think that is, in itself, a real marker of the decline of good sex, both in the sense of pleasurable sex but also what she calls good or ethical sex, which I think that there’s more sex within marriage, and I think women enjoy sex better in marriage when they can be more vulnerable. So I guess in that way, freeing women to have sex just like men, which is basically what the pill and abortion do, I think also hasn’t been good for women. It sounds like I’m just blaming men. But men have blasts of testosterone beating through them in a way that’s different from — it’s distinguished from women. And that does tend to lend to greater sexual desire and sexual aggression, especially sex that is quicker and easier, quicker release. It’s a different kind of sex than women want. And so to really engage in the kind of sex that women want, that is slower, that is in commitment, that is attentive to a woman’s sexual needs and desires I think really requires, if there’s going to be an equalizing, that men change their responses to their sexual appetites to be more attentive to what women need rather than vice versa, which is what I think we’ve done. |  | ezra klein |  | There’s definitely a part of me that is having a not all men moment right here. But putting male defensiveness aside — |  | erika bachiochi |  | And I agree. I agree. [LAUGHS] |  | ezra klein |  | This is, I think, a key interlock here. So even if I grant the claim, even if you grant the claim that sex is better within committed partnership, which I think is probably broadly true, what I understand you as arguing is that the wide use of contraception, certainly what you call techno-pharmacological contraception, is somewhere in between a problem and at least something worth rethinking — that Roe should be overturned, which is, I think, what we’re going, abortion should be either illegal or extremely, extremely hard to access. And that seems like a pretty different claim, actually, than it would be good if there was more committed relationships, and people had more confidence and capability to relax into the pleasures of sex and the connection of sex within these contexts. And so it sometimes seems to me that the argument being made here isn’t just that there would be more pleasure in this world, but, actually, we need a lot more potential punishment. There needs to be a lot more fear, disciplining sex, fear of getting pregnant, fear of having a child that you’re not ready to have or maybe is not safe for you to have. And so people have — even if they’re not all happy with what got called hookup culture a couple of years ago, people have widely embraced these solutions as helping them live lives that they hope to be able to make a better existence for themselves within. So what about our sexual culture would be improved by dramatically less techno-pharmacological contraception and no or very limited access to abortion? Can you draw that link in your argument for me? |  | erika bachiochi |  | Yeah, I think that we’ve seen that there’s a connection — and this is what, again, you see in the sexual economic work — that the pill kind of inspires this change in sexual behavior so that there’s more sexual risk-taking both inside and outside of marriage. And so this, of course, is what gets you to the link I was talking about there toward single motherhood. But so what’s interesting is to go back to how the early American women’s rights advocates thought about this, because I think many people now know that they were opposed to abortion. And we can kind of talk about how they thought in a very nuanced way. But they really were worried about these threats of undisciplined male sexual desire. And they saw that you can make men and women equal in a lot of different ways. And as I’ve talked about, you can bring, I think, women down to men’s standards, which is freewheeling quick sex. Or you can bring men up to women’s standards, which is actually what these women were hoping for, that they could convince men that voluntary motherhood, this idea — I mean, it sounds a lot like our desire not to have forced motherhood, which is a real kind of pro-choice slogan. But what it is, is their belief, their understanding that women were mothers as soon as they got pregnant and that they should voluntarily enter into that state because of the asymmetrical burdens for them. And therefore, they should voluntarily have sex, which means they could have the right to say no to sex within marriage. But what they wanted in response was not actually abortion or contraception. What they wanted was this sense that there should be abstinence during the fertile period. Now, at that time, there was no good medical science that helped them to understand when the fertile period was. And so there were all sorts of unintended pregnancies, which obviously made the whole situation worse in some ways. But there’s been a lot of advance in our day. And I think if we hadn’t been relying on abortion and contraception that we’d see even more advanced in the way in which natural fertility regulation has come around. You see all sorts of young women, actually — I hear they’re on TikTok being angry about contraception and really being interested, more interested in natural fertility regulation. I haven’t seen them myself. Friends tell me that. But I think there is a move because — kind of an ecological case against hormonal birth control, that throwing a lot of hormones into the waterways hasn’t been great for aquatic life. But I think the same could be said for ourselves. We want organic food. We want to take care of our bodies in all sorts of ways. And yet here we are consuming vast quantities of hormones to regulate our cycles. And so because of the harms of the casual sex culture to women, because they’re not interested in it, you’re seeing the way in which perhaps these natural fertility regulation may be better. And there’s a way in which, too, because it demands abstinence of men during certain times, that it is getting them to be more aware in their bodies just as women are every month because of menses of really the connection between sex and potential parenthood. And I think that’s a good thing. |  | ezra klein |  | So for people who maybe aren’t familiar, can you say more about what you mean by natural fertility regulation? What does that actually entail for people on a practical level? |  | erika bachiochi |  | Yeah, so though I’m no expert on natural fertility regulation, it’s an area of medicine that has really grown and changed a lot over the last several decades. And now there’s all sorts of apps and things for your phone and all of that. But generally, what it is, is it’s getting an understanding, a much deeper, better understanding of women’s fertility. So there are all sorts of signs of fertility that a woman’s body, I guess you could say, emits, things like cervical fluid, rises and falls in temperature, that indicate to the woman how fertile she is and when she could get pregnant. [MUSIC PLAYING] |  | ezra klein |  | So the argument here — and I noticed this in the book, too. It feels to me that it operates at two levels that are a little bit different or worth interrogating. So one is this level of — we could call it the ideal or what culture should understand as virtuous. And I might have different views on this. But let’s grant yours here. So if things go right is a way to put this, right? If the rhythm method or other forms of natural contraception are very, very well followed, if abstinence is very well followed, if within committed relationships aren’t things like coercion or abuse or just pressure — there’s just a lot of pressure in relationships. There’s fear of people being left. And so one version is we should have the sexual ideal that is more restrained, more disciplined, more held back than what we currently have. But law — and a lot of this book is about law, and a lot of your advocacy is about law. Law is very much about what happens when things go wrong, when you have sex and maybe you wish you hadn’t, or the form of contraception you were using fails. I mean, my understanding of the data is that about a quarter of people who try natural contraception of the kind you’re describing will get pregnant in the first year. Now, if you do it perfectly, that number’s lower, but it’s very, very, very hard to do perfectly. And maybe people could get better, but people are people. And so the question, I think, then becomes, what should happen when things fail? And as I understand your argument, what should happen when things fail, when you or your partner want to have sex in a relationship or even non-relationship where you’re not ready for children, or you’re in a relationship where you already have children, and you didn’t want more, and you’re using the rhythm method but actually got pregnant anyway, is that it would be better — it would be better for women. It would be better for families. It would be better for society if, at that point, you had fewer options. Like, you could not end a pregnancy. I really can’t quite tell what your view is on more technological contraception, but at least you’re philosophically against. So I think the question is, knowing humans as we do, that’s not going to work out for a lot of people. And what happens to them? Why would it be better for them to be in this world where a moment of impulsivity or misregulating your cycle or feeling pressured by your husband results in a pregnancy that you really didn’t want and now cannot end? |  | erika bachiochi |  | Yeah, so I do want to get to the question of abortion, which I think is obviously a very important one. I just want to correct you, though, on this idea of the, quote, “rhythm method,” which is really, really an old, old understanding of this. I mean, it’s like a half century old or something. And that actually the best methods rival the birth control pill, are 1 percent — I mean, the birth control pill also requires a certain discipline, that you take it every day. And so there are method failure and user failure rates for both. But it’s a question of which one is better, I think, for the woman especially but for the couple. And I think, again, I would not advocate all of the different methods of natural fertility regulation. I think some are not as good. But there are some that are excellent, and I actually have end notes on this where you can find some of the differences. The interesting thing about this — I mean, I am under no illusion that you can put the toothpaste back in the tube, and everyone will stop using contraception. I’m very much aware that there are many people for whom contraception, whatever their form of contraception, they’re happy with it. It’s given them a lot of options in their life and all that. And one thing that I think is really interesting is how easy access to abortion as we’ve had, at least prior to, say, the last 10, 15 years when obviously red states have been able to regulate a lot more and push a lot of abortion clinics out of states — but generally easy access to abortion actually tends to disincentivize contraceptive use. So there’s a way in which because it’s there as a backstop, it changes the behavior of those who are engaging in sex, both engaging in sexual risk-taking in terms of having more of it and changing their decision-making around whether they should have sex or not, but also with regard to how careful they are about their contraception. So I would say that if you’re really pro-contraception and even if you think natural fertility regulation is a crock or whatever, and if you really want to see more people using contraception as a way to, say, lower the abortion rate, then actually restricting abortion more would tend to do that. So my view of that is good, then restrict abortion more, because then people will take the sexual act more seriously and be more responsible with their sexual activity. And then, of course, we come to the question of abortion, which is a huge matter in itself. But it seems to me that going back to how the early women’s rights advocates thought about it is also really helpful. I think there’s a lot of wisdom there, in the sense that they believed, based on advances in embryology at the time, which is also what was informing the doctors who are lobbying for enhanced restrictions of abortion, those early women’s rights advocates — so like Victoria Woodhull, who is a real radical, definitely not a Christian — others, too, like her, not Christians — but understood, as she said, that the rights of the child should begin while they’re a fetus, who saw that mothers had this responsibility for embryonic life. That’s how she talked about it. And so what they wanted to do is improve conditions so much for women, so improve maternal and fetal health. They opened female-led hospitals for women, maternity homes for women so that women who are abandoned by men would have — be given the skills and the confidence to care for their children, and also, of course, entry into the professions, all of these things so that women would not feel this kind of desperate need to abort. I think it’s really good to go back and understand how is it that they saw abortion as both an act of violence against the unborn child but also a way in which it opened the floodgates to this presumptive male sexuality. And just to ask, is there a way in which, if we limited abortion more, we could realign things and start to work really for the justice of both the children to whom I think care is due but then also to women and men who are caregivers to whom we owe a lot more duties because of the work they do in the home than society right now is willing to afford them? |  | ezra klein |  | Well, I do think this actually gets to the nut of it, because I want to keep what the goals of different people in this conversation are very clear. So in the abortion conversation we just had, you made an argument there that if we didn’t have abortion, people would use contraception more effectively, more nearly universally. I don’t really agree with that. I think there’s actually quite good evidence out of places like Delaware. There are very good programs that have been put forward where contraception use actually does get abortion rates down. But even if I grant the argument here, I think it’s important to ask the question of, what is the end? I think the reason a lot of people want there to be rights to all kinds of contraception, including IUDs and things that — I do disagree with you on the evidence here — I think are much more effective than natural methods and much easier to follow. But in addition to that, that if these things fail, or somebody fails to use them, or if somebody is in a somewhat coerced situation emotionally or otherwise where they’re not easy to use, or if they end up in a situation that could be harmful for their health, they have the ability to continue charting their own life’s course. That’s why you end up at something like the equilibrium that many liberals have now. And your argument is that equilibrium is wrong, that a mistake has been made. And I think you got to it at the end there, that having the ability to have abortion has been bad for women, bad for family policy bad, for the movement. And so I do want to try to draw out that argument. And let me ask it this way. So there’s a recent New York Times analysis of data on the typical abortion patient. And it found that they have children. They’re poor. They’re unmarried. They’re in their late 20s. They have some college education. And they’re very early in pregnancy. That’s the modal person who gets an abortion. So if that wasn’t there, how would those women be better off? What is the argument for their welfare that you’re making? |  | erika bachiochi |  | So before I get back to that, I just want to clarify my position on contraception. So I do not disagree with you that contraception lowers abortion rates. I think that that’s true. But I also think that restrictions on abortion get people to use contraception more. So I think that there’s this causal line that goes both ways. And we’ve relied, I think, on free and easy abortion access, which then disincentivizes contraceptive use. But I think if you actually have restrictions on abortion, then you’re going to see more contraception, and therefore, it then ends up having fewer abortions anyway. So I think that all works OK together. |  | ezra klein |  | Right. But I think the reason I’m pushing on that little point is that I don’t think more contraceptive use is your goal. And I also don’t think it’s the goal of the people on the other side of the argument, which is why that particular argument strikes me as weird. |  | erika bachiochi |  | I mean, in some ways, I don’t know that women today, with the state of how women think in terms of that they owe men sex at having a beer, a cup of coffee, or something — that the cost of sex is so low right now that I’m not sure that I can convince women that it would be so much better for them, for their relationships, for their enjoyment of sex to go out and learn natural fertility regulation. I am not Pollyanna on that. I would prefer more contraception use to more abortion, if that makes sense, even though I think that natural fertility regulation is better for women than contraception. I don’t think it has to be kind of a black and white thing, right? An IUD, for instance, there’s a lot of push for women to have IUDs. And I see it from one perspective. I mean, I think Isabel Sawhill in “Unbound Generation” probably makes the very strongest argument for IUDs there, where she talks about that you don’t want to make a longstanding choice that really changes your whole life when you’re in the heat of the moment when it’s there to put on a condom or something. And so an IUD, as she says, changes the default to infertile rather than fertile. And that, to me, I can get how that would lower both abortion rates and out-of-wedlock childbearing and all of that. And I see those all as a goal. But I also think that IUDs, again, increase the sexual risk-taking or the sexual — the casual sex culture to think that it’s really normative to engage in casual sex. And I think, again, this has been bad for women, for their emotions, for all sorts of things. So in that way, I think if you’re defaulting to infertile, you’re also defaulting to the yes, right? So in this casual sex culture, you’re defaulting to, sure, yeah, we’re going to have sex versus the default being a no and that there has to be all sorts of affirmations by a woman to engage in sex. |  | ezra klein |  | I think I would have probably some dispute over how defaulted things are to yes. I mean, I think it’s not as lightly held as people say. And the actual data is that teenagers and young adults are having less sex — not much, much more. In many ways, I think the hookup panic of a couple of years ago didn’t really pan out. And in some ways, people are being much more restrained to the point that many see that as a social problem. But nevertheless, we’re still dealing with the reality that whatever methods people choose, whatever’s really going on, many people, and I think even more under some of the situations that you’re more interested in, will become pregnant in a situation where they really don’t want to be. And so I noted that the modal person who seeks an abortion, according to this New York Times analysis, they have children. They’re poor. They’re unmarried. They’re in their late 20s. They have some college. They’re very early in pregnancy. I think you’re making an argument throughout that they would be better off, not just that the unborn child would be better off, but they would be better off if they did not have the ability to get an abortion. And I’m asking from that perspective. How? Why? |  | erika bachiochi |  | Yeah, so there’s certainly women, as you say, in the situation where — have abortions, early term abortions in very difficult situations. Most have children and are poor. And I think, one, if you look at even the way women think about — and different classes of people think about abortion, those who are poor actually tend to have more moral reservations of abortion. So you then see women, I think because of economic coercion, because they don’t have the financial capacity to have another child, that they’re economically coerced into engaging in an act, the act of abortion, which goes up against their moral values, which is deeply concerning to me. But it takes the attention off the real structural problems in the lives of the poor, whether it’s substandard health conditions, whether it’s poor housing, whether it’s neglectful or absent fathers or the fact that their fathers can’t get work and so can’t pay child support. All of these things, I think it takes attention off that when we have abortion as kind of an easy solution and, in some way, the privileged solution to poverty, because it’s always this kind of thing, is like it kind of concerns me when we say, come on, shouldn’t that be the answer to this poor woman’s problem, is for her to have an abortion? And it’s like, well, I don’t know that that’s, A, what she would really want. And I think that see that, actually, in a lot of the lives of poor women, that they would choose not to have an abortion if they thought that they could afford to have a child. And so that is of great concern to me, is that we’re putting poor women in a situation where the best we can get, the richest country in the history of the world, is to offer them the means to have abortions. |  | ezra klein |  | I think this is where you can see the pathways branching out. And I think this is, in many ways, like the core of it, because I think I agree with you to a large extent there. And I think most people on the left and most people who are pro-choice would, which is people should not have to make a decision they don’t want to make because of poverty. They should not have to make a decision they don’t want to make because the supports are not there for the family they want to have. I always want people to have the range of choices that they want for their own life flourishing open to them. But the argument you’re making actually quite explicitly in the book is that the way to get there is to close off the choice for abortion, not to just say, hey, I’m going to join with people on the left. I’m going to join the Bernie Sanders movement, who I know you actually did support at one time, I think, early in your life. We’re really going to try to restructure family policy. You do have those ideas. But core to it is that you want to close off the option to abortion. And that’s where I think a lot of people would get off the bus there. They don’t want somebody to have to make that choice. But they do want that choice to be available to them. And more to the point, they don’t believe that people who make that choice for non-coerced reasons, people who make that choice because it is just the right choice for them, not because they don’t have the money or the moment — but maybe they have three kids. Maybe one of them has developmental disabilities already. Maybe they cannot in their view do a good job caring for another child and still lead anything like the life they’ve hoped for for themselves — that in that scenario, which is I think a quite common one, not necessarily the exact but broadly, that having the choice makes people better off than they would otherwise be. And I think you’re saying it doesn’t, and it doesn’t because having the choice has made it so they don’t have any of these other policies. And that’s where I have a little bit of trouble following you. |  | erika bachiochi |  | Yeah. And I think that’s really a pointed question and an important one. Because my view is that unlimited choice itself — so, first of all, we have to remember how radical our abortion law has been in this country. It strengthens — I mean, this is coming from pro-choice Georgetown law professor Robin West — I think has been really good on this, where she has talked about how these choice-based arguments basically strengthen the kind of impulse of our very libertarian culture and politics to leave women with the consequences of the bargain, basically, the consequences of her having gotten pregnant. And I think if you think about it, it’s not just a coercion, say, like, oh, her boyfriend is telling her to have an abortion, or he won’t stay with her. But there’s also a real deep — because of I think of our libertarian culture, a real deep antinatalism, an anti — the way in which we treat pregnant women in the workplace culture, massive pregnancy discrimination still, the kind of workplace conditions that especially poor women have, where they have to return to work. Many women have to return to work within like two weeks or less of giving birth. And so there’s all sorts of structural conditions where there is still no choice. So, yes, I think there should be massive realignment where there’s a real renewed attention to — and we can talk about how I might differ with how the left thinks about that — but support of caregiving. But just the fact that there is a choice means that employers see it as a cheaper choice. And so this is exactly why you have employers, corporations, you have states talking about the corporate case for reproductive health — is that it’s a far cheaper option than accommodations for pregnancy, accommodations for caregiving. And so when they’re thinking about the bottom line, this is the way they’re going to go. |  | ezra klein |  | I think the argument you’re making here would make an implicit prediction. If it’s the existence of choice that is strengthening this libertarian culture, that is strengthening, I guess, employers who want women to get abortions so there’s no interruption to their time in the workplace, I think then you’d expect to see much more pro-family policies in places that are opposed to abortion rights, not in places where they’re broadly supported. But that’s not what you see. So to give an example, 11 states have enacted paid family leave laws — California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Massachusetts, Maryland, New Jersey, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island and Washington. All of them, every single one of them has a firm commitment to abortion rights. And then if you look on the other side of that, the 13 states with trigger laws that will make abortion illegal the moment Roe is overturned or very, very shortly thereafter, none of them have paid leave laws on the books. And so that makes it hard for me to believe that it’s the choice here that is leading to the anti-family policy. Because it seems to me that a lot of these more pro-family, less market-driven policies that you would prefer, that you would see as evidence of a more pro-family equilibrium are actually supported and implemented by the coalition that also believes in abortion rights. |  | erika bachiochi |  | Right, and when you look at those states who, again, sitting here in Massachusetts, have much better pro-woman, pro-family policies, they also have very high abortion rates. And so we don’t really know what it is that’s pushing women to have those abortions. It would seem that if you had all those pro-family policies, then the abortion rate would go down if we were only going to kind of trust this idea that pro-family policy equals lower abortion rates when that’s not the case either. So it seems to me that neither the red states or the blue states are doing a good job at this. So basically, like, red states can’t be able to stand on their — if Roe is overturned, their post-Roe abortion bans basically as this kind of evidence of their pro-life accomplishment and then have their pregnant residents basically face poverty, substandard health care as compared to the blue states, and basically far worse workplace accommodations that have been required by law. But I think in the same way that the blue states can’t then stand on all their more generous health, welfare and work supports as evidence of their pro-woman bona fides while there’s this kind of, again, coercive underbelly of unlimited choice. So in these states, there is going then to be some sort of coercion toward abortion. And, again, it’s not necessarily by the employer looking at them and pointing their finger. But because of its availability, it becomes an open option and something that, because it’s much harder to have a child than walk into an abortion clinic, it becomes an easier choice for that person, one which potentially a woman then suffers regrets from. The better answer is to have abortion restrictions and have these pro-family policies. Are the red states doing it? No. Am I hoping to try to convince them to do it? Yes, absolutely. I mean, I think that that’s the work of the pro-life movement going forward. |  | ezra klein |  | But I don’t think — I mean, and I do believe this is where some of this diverges. I don’t know that the goal of paid family leave policy or of child care policy or of a lot of other things that I would think of as pro-family or, for that matter, of a child allowance policy, which you put into the book, which I very deeply agree with — I don’t think most liberals who support those policies would say the actual point of them is to lower abortion rates. It is to give people the opportunity to make a less coerced choice and that anything that reduces a coercion of that choice is the goal. So having better paid family leave, I don’t think it would be a huge, huge, huge driver of people’s fertility decisions one way or the other. I just think it’s good. And I think it’s telling that it comes from the places where the general view is people should have more choices, because you keep using coercion here as the term, the description for the decision people make to have an abortion. But I think a lot of people — and I would be one of them — would understand coercion as, at least as properly, if not more so, applying to a world where women no longer had the opportunity to end an unwanted pregnancy. And it’s specifically because of the absence of this idea and this reality of choice — I mean, you said many people end up regretting abortion. But I don’t think actually the evidence really holds that so deeply. The best study I know of on this is the Turnaway Study, which was able to look at people who got turned away from having an abortion and people who didn’t. And five years on, 99% of women, 99% who had the abortion said it was the right decision for them. And they were better off on a range of other health and economic outcomes. So I can understand the argument that abortion should be illegal because it is the taking of a life. And I simply disagree with that. But the argument being made here that it’s better for women to not have this choice, I don’t think that’s right. And I think the people standing on the other side of it are not making the distinction you’re making. They’re not saying, we should have more abortion so that we can have more market. It’s the same people who are saying, you Roe should be upheld. We’re working assiduously to try to give people more room from the market to make decisions for their families and for their lives. Now, maybe that’s a big coalition that can be built, and I hope so. But that’s why I’m trying to pick at the logic of this causal connection between having abortion rights and having anti-family policy. Because I think in the places where you would think that would bite, you see, in fact, the exact opposite. |  | erika bachiochi |  | Yeah, so I think it’s important — and I want to really get to kind of push you a little bit on the abortion question. But before I do so, when you look at actually the Turnaway Study, one thing that wasn’t as highlighted is the fact that for those women who were actually denied an abortion, only one week after seeking an abortion but then being denied it, 35 percent of those women no longer wished they could have aborted. And then five years after having been denied abortion, when they have, I don’t know, a four-year-old or so, 96% of those women said they no longer wish they could have had one. So there is a way in which that abortion choice, especially in the way that we have it, it allows a woman to do something that may not be in her best interest down the road. Then, of course, the question of the interests of the child, which I think I want to push you on, because I’m always sort of shocked that progressives — and this is something Daniel Williams points out in his book about the history of the pro-life movement — that progressives tend to be very concerned with vulnerability, with care for the vulnerable, care for the dependent. And I guess I don’t really understand sometimes why it is that suddenly, there’s all this talk about autonomy, and there’s, I think, a very Lockean approach to the way progressives talk about abortion rights and this idea that the child — well, they don’t call the child — the fetus is like a trespasser on their property of their body, the self-ownership of their body, again, in a very Lockean way — and they then have this right to dispel anyone who comes through it in kind of an absolute property right, when it seems to me that progressives, I think, and in the progressive tradition, that there’s a better understanding of the duties of care we owe one another, that we’re all interdependent, that there’s more of a responsibility for those who are vulnerable and dependent. And it seems to me that the child, who is a human being and is really utterly dependent on his or her mother at that time for those nine months, is the most vulnerable and the most dependent. And so it brings more obligations for that woman to not only give care to the child but then also to have the community around her, first and foremost the child’s father, but then all of society, find ways to help her, that there are these kind of interweaving dependencies and duties of care. And I guess I don’t understand why it is that we could not think that there are two human beings here. And certainly their rights to life can conflict sometimes. And that’s a time when the mother’s life at that point could very much be prioritized, and the death of the child could be a sad result but a result nonetheless. But why is it that we don’t think of the duties of care that are owed to this other human being, who is vulnerable, who is dependent? And I guess I don’t understand why progressives have — suddenly, they start talking, and they’re John Locke. Like, they’re these property rights gurus. And it just doesn’t fly with me in terms of the way progressives think about the solidarity that we ought to have with the poor in general. |  | ezra klein |  | I don’t know about property rights gurus. So we’ll see if you think my answer here sounds too Lockean to you. I’ll say a couple of things. One, I don’t think these decisions are easy for most people. And in part because I don’t think they’re easy, and because in part I don’t think people take them lightly, I don’t think they are best made by the government. I don’t believe in a positive duty to have abortions. I believe in people’s ability to make decisions for themselves that are the right decisions. And I don’t take any of this abstractly. I won’t speak for all progressives, but I have two children. I have a three-year-old and a seven-month-old. And they are everything to me. I mean, they are everything. And I had the experience of watching my wife go through two of the most medically agonizing, dangerous pregnancies I have ever been anywhere near. And watching someone hurt that much every single day for five months — and I don’t want to tell more of her story than it’s mine to tell — made me much more firm in my view that this is not for other people or even chance to tell people how to make that decision. And if, within my committed partnership, my marriage where we take care of two children and two mediocrely behaved dogs and have a lot of responsibilities and try to live lives, I think as you describe in the book, where virtue and obligation are central to the way we think of every single day, if we got pregnant again, it would be dangerous. And the idea that somebody else is going to come in and say, too bad, I think I know better than you what that means. So obviously, some of this results down to questions of personhood and how you understand the way moral weight and rights develop. And I’m somebody who thinks a fetus at 10 weeks is different than someone at 30 weeks and doesn’t think there’s any easy way to draw the line. But nevertheless, a lot of politics and a lot of hard policymaking is creating space where at least people can draw their own lines to some degree. But it is not because to me there isn’t a duty to care for the vulnerable, but the people have some amount of right to self-determination, that there are a lot of ways to bring and support life in this world. There’d be a lot of ways to help people have children they deeply want to have and cannot because of medical reasons, because of financial reasons. And having the state come in and tell people that because their husband coerced them one night off of the — or just because he had a night of passion, doesn’t need to be coerced — because they felt really in love that night, that now you have a fifth child who you don’t know how you can care for. I don’t think you have to imagine an unborn child as a trespasser to think that people should have the ability and will be better off if they have the ability to set their own life course in that moment. And so I want to make that choice as free as possible. I want to make sure people have every support they want. I would like to have, and I believe one should have, a more natalist equilibrium in this country by a lot. But I don’t think — and this is where I think we disagree quite deeply — I don’t think the way to get there is taking away people’s choices. One of my concerns about this sometimes is that I think when we’re talking about women here — I think it would be different if we were actually talking about unborn children. But I think it sounds very abstract. But I think the choices people actually have to make are agonizing, and they agonize over them. And we should trust often that they know better than we do. |  | erika bachiochi |  | Yeah, I mean, I obviously appreciate the difficult circumstances that you personally had. And I think there are many women who have difficult or dangerous pregnancies. Most don’t. Most pregnancies aren’t dangerous and are natural experiences of bringing human life into the world. And I guess the most fundamental difference, I think, that we have is that for me, when the child exists, it’s a new human being who is a self-directed human being who has parts of both myself and the father, the mother and the father, and therefore is our child, that we owe duties to that child as much as possible as we owe duties to our other children who are already born. And so to my mind, the medical establishment ought to be always thinking of those two patients together, the mother and the child, because not only does the mother owe those duties and the father owes those duties to the child and the father to the mother as well. But the medical establishment also owes those duties to both mother and child at that time. So to my mind, I think that there’s, again, a way in which we have not made as many advances in maternal care and fetal care for women in difficult pregnancies, in difficult situations because we’ve had that easy answer. I don’t mean easy as in not difficult for a mother and potentially a father to make in terms of agonizing, emotionally agonizing, but that it’s kind of there for the taking, rather than having pushed further to say, there are two patients here to whom we owe these duties of care. And so we ought to find ways to ensure that as much as possible, we can make sure that the child is cared for. Now, are there times when there are life-threatening situations or times in which there could be serious bodily injury, which would require either the early delivery of a child or, in cases of ectopic pregnancy, the removal of the embryo from the Fallopian tubes to save the life of the mother? I mean, all these kinds of things are, it seems to me, quite humane to allow just out of basic proportionality, basically saying, yes, there are two lives here, and we ought to care for both. But the mother does take some priority. But I think, again, we could restructure things so that both are taken seriously and so that we owe this duty as much as possible to this other child. |  | ezra klein |  | So the other question that a lot of people have when they think about Roe falling, when they look at some of these trigger laws is, what happens in the case of rape when women seek abortions? In April, Oklahoma’s Governor Kevin Stitt signed legislation that bans abortion and does not have an exemption for rape. How do you think about those cases? |  | erika bachiochi |  | I think you’re seeing there’s just more and more people who call themselves abortion abolitionists who would not want to see these kinds of exceptions. The child who is conceived in rape has the same equal dignity, and therefore, the same sort of duties of care are owed. And so in that way, I think that there’s all sorts of women out there whose parents conceived them in rape and whose mothers heroically gave birth to them despite this violent assault on them. And so there are those who argue in the pro-life movement that abortion is actually kind of a second violent act against the pregnant woman. My view of this is that I think because of the entire lack of consent to engage in that act that can foreseeably cause a pregnancy, that it’s understandable as a prudential matter to allow abortion in that case. I mean, I think it should be limited into very early pregnancy. I think something like the morning after pill would obviously be the best possible situation. But I think that’s my answer, is that were she to go to a hospital and then be given something to potentially even prevent conception would be the best possible route. I think one thing that actually — my tribe does poorly is — has this idea that because they’re equal rights, because the argument is that, by virtue of being human, the week-old embryo has equal rights to the mother who is out walking around carrying this embryo, that there aren’t differences and differences in wrongs of late stage versus early stage abortions. And for my tribe, I would really commend to them the work of Christopher Kaczor on this, where he has an essay called “Equal Rights and Unequal Wrongs.” And so to my mind, an abortion restriction that restricted late-term abortions would be very much a celebration, even if it allowed some early term abortions. I think that is a place that, in my own state, I hope we can work toward, that there’s ways to think about abortion where having those late stage abortions are worse, worse for — obviously, they’re the same. You’re still taking the child’s life. But they’re worse for society. They’re worse for the mother. They’re sort of a worse moral act. And I hope we can take that seriously as well. |  | ezra klein |  | So I respect and disagree with the view, I mean, I guess obviously, that there is a quality of weight and rights the whole way through. And that’s a place where I think the abortion debate is really hard. Because once you end up on opposite sides of that line, you’re just dealing with very different and somewhat unresolvable moral and philosophical and religious intuitions. But one thing that interested me about your book is that you really — I think you believe that argument. And, again, I want to say clearly, like, I respect that argument. It’s not my view. But I see how it is held, and I believe it’s held very, very strongly and humanely. But you are making an argument through the book. You really try to frame this around what is best for women. You really push on, say, the idea that abortion has led to a feminization of poverty, that it has led to all of these downstream bad outcomes that have been bad for people who do want to use that choice, who do see this differently than you do. And that’s where I think it’s an important point. And I think it’s actually a very important move in this debate. Because particularly in a world where Roe is about to be overturned and where we can’t govern directly through religious argumentation, people are going to be trying to make arguments about what is better for a lot of different classes in this discussion that can be proven, measured, discussed. And so that’s why I’m kind of pushing on this question of the outcomes for women. I’ll give you another example of this that struck me reading the book. So you lament throughout the book, and I think correctly, this pretty profound now divergence in marriage numbers and divorce numbers and single parenthood numbers between college-educated and non-college educated women. We’ve mentioned Isabel Sawhill’s work here, and she makes this point that marriage and having children inside a marriage has become a very important and profound class marker. But when I think about restricting abortion, potentially restricting contraception or pushing people towards forms of contraception that are, I think, at least more difficult to use, I think it’s very clear that would make that divergence worse. I mean, I think the obvious outcome there would be highly educated resourced women are going to have high quality contraception. They’re going to have the ability to get abortions. And poor women, particularly in red states, don’t. And so it’s that argument that I’m trying to untangle, that it seems to me that you’re justifying some of these arguments on, for instance, saying, we’ll get to a more equal world there. But what flaw do you see in my logic? How would that not make the world and the outcomes here more unequal? |  | erika bachiochi |  | Yeah, well, I guess I see that if you restrict abortion — and, again, if you — in general, what it helps us to do, especially if there are really important legislative debates, especially in purple states, I think we’re going to see, about really what we owe the unborn child, I think those are the kinds of legislative debates that we haven’t been able to have because Roe foreclosed those. And I think those are essential to both what we owe the child but then what we owe the child’s mother, what we owe the child’s father, what all of society owes the family. And I think those kinds of debates are essential for us going forward because we’ve been able to kind of sit in this, I think, sexual, more libertarian on the left and economically more libertarian on the right. And I think that Roe is going to require us to think about all of those kind of views that we hold. And I’m looking forward to those debates. But in terms of the poor woman, I think what it does, by resetting this question, is that the law does teach. And by saying that there are all sorts of people, maybe not everyone in the country obviously, who believe that there is — a child’s life is taken in an abortion and that we actually owe duties to that child, that it helps reset thinking about sex itself, that I think it ought to help us take sex more seriously. And that itself may empower women — I hope it would empower women — to kind of take their place again as gatekeepers of sex. And that is to expect more from men when they engage in sex, to expect commitment. Because if they do wait, if they are able to put off men and to expect more from them, to expect a greater maturity, to expect them to hold down a job, to expect them to get off their computers and get off porn and all sorts of things, that I think there could be a real maturation of men that is required. I’m not saying that it is women who mature men. Men mature themselves. But by women taking seriously these asymmetrical burdens that she holds in sexual intercourse, that it hopefully will empower her to just say no more and expect more and then, as the economists say, raise the cost of sex. I think that would be a good thing. And I think that would be a very good thing in poor neighborhoods where women just don’t have the bargaining power that wealthy, educated women have in relationships. And so that’s my hope that we would see something like that. And I’ll certainly be working toward that. |  | ezra klein |  | That feels strange to me given, I think, the pattern in what we’ve seen in family formation and outcomes in poor neighborhoods over the past however many decades. And so I think let me try to give an alternative account, and you can tell me where you see holes in it. One of the things that has struck me about a lot of the rising right-wing thinking about the family and about the crisis of single parenthood and divorce and low marriage rates in poor communities is that for a long time, this same critique was being made, but it was aimed really tightly at the Black community, going all the way back to the famous Moynihan Report on the problems of the Black family. And what emerged out of it, I think, was a view, to go to your point about law as teacher, that the people needed to be taught. They needed a cultural upheaval. And two things came out of that. So, one, there was a tremendous amount of condemnation, responsibility politics, on both sides of the aisle. You heard this from Bill Clinton. You sometimes heard it from Jesse Jackson. You heard it at moments from Barack Obama. But for a long time, there was a real belief that what had to happen is people had to be told in the Black community. The men weren’t taking responsibility, and there are these cultural pathologies — and then, as you say, the law was supposed to be teacher. We were going to incarcerate many more people through much tougher criminal policies, that we were going to push much harder through work requirements in welfare. We were going to use the law to teach people how we wanted them to act. And what I would say is true about that period is it completely and utterly failed. And then what happened is many of these issues that we saw in Black communities began to show up at a lag in white communities. And so as that happened, I think that the way particularly the right, although not only, began to approach them became much more humane, much more, well, they’ve been failed by policy. There are economic problems. Addiction is a disease. How opioids have been treated versus how crack was treated is very, very, very telling. But when I look at it, what I see is a kind of consistent — two consistent things. One is that across rich countries all over the world, you’re seeing declines in marriage rates, rising single parenthood. European countries have lower marriage rates than we do. And there is a lot of evidence, I think, at this point that pretty unchecked capitalism and a lot of inequality is a real driver of family breakdown in poor communities. And this goes to your point and the oft-made observation that college-educated people tend to be marrying and having children within marriage and staying married at much higher rates. And I think the very simple takeaway from that is that when you don’t have the economic stress on the relationship, the relationship is more likely to form and is also more likely to survive. So there does seem to me to be a tremendous amount of pressure and reason we should be really, really working and really lamenting and really trying to repair how much economic damage we’ve done. But I think one place I really diverge is I am very skeptical — and from having watched this play out in different ways, I’m very skeptical that trying to punish people more, culturally or otherwise, or through the law, trying to use the law as a harsh teacher, works. Because I think if it did work, we would have seen it work when we used it very, very harshly for a very long time. |  | erika bachiochi |  | Yeah, I guess I am not seeing the law as the harsh teacher or the punisher. I’m not sure where you’re getting that out of my work. I actually think massive incarceration is a massive problem because of the way in which it pulls fathers away from their children. To me, it seems like it’s not just the poor who need self-discipline. It’s all of us who need self-discipline. Like, this is just a basic means toward happiness. And it just so happens that in wealthier elite families, there’s more habits of self-discipline because of schooling and all sorts of things like that. And it seems like it’s an important human goal to have parents be the ones who inculcate self-discipline in their children and there, by doing that, inculcate self-discipline in themselves. So I don’t really see it as like the state being the one who’s disciplining people at all. But I just see it as something where when we take the natural facts of human reproduction seriously, that there are asymmetrical burdens on women, and therefore women should hold men off more and expect more from them, I don’t see anything punitive there at all. I actually just see women being empowered with really kind of the facts of life. And in the same way, I think that enabling and, again, empowering the poor to take seriously the really important work of the home, of rearing children is basically what the rich already do. And it’s kind of not fair that the wealthy, the rich, the well-educated see how important it is to prioritize their children’s development, their children’s moral and intellectual development, and then say, oh, well, we shouldn’t expect that of the poor. To me, that is actually more of a flawed way of thinking about the capacities of the poor. And this is something I really, I think, learned from Mary Wollstonecraft, who really saw equality — like our human equality is not in how much property we own or wealth we have or how much money we make or anything. But it’s just in our equal human capacity for moral development. And I think rich and poor both have that and that that should be an expectation that our laws have, is that we all ought to be striving for moral development. And so we ought not shield moral responsibility from the poor or the rich, that our laws and our policies should be enabling people to carry out their obligations to one another, because, I think, in general, that’s how people develop virtuously. And that tends to lead toward both personal and societal happiness. |  | ezra klein |  | I mean, I do think this gets to a very key thing in your thought, which is that the structure of our laws, the structure of our culture should be more oriented towards pushing people towards a certain definition but of a virtuous and excellent life. Virtue is very hard to conduct. And I think one place where I think you and I have parted a bit is I want to limit often the consequences for people who have had moments where their commitment to self-discipline or self-mastery failed. You were saying earlier that a lot of pregnancies, most pregnancies, in fact, are not dangerous. And I take that point. But parenting is very profound. It alters and transforms your life deeply. And I don’t think most parents, really not myself, would then go and say, well, I regret having children. But it’s something that I think really, really, really radically changes everything. And it can be dangerous for people. I mean, it’s much safer now. But a lot of women die in childbirth, particularly a lot of Black women die in childbirth. And so to me, there’s something here about I could kind of imagine why one would want a social movement that is pushing restraint, that is pushing this idea, as you have it, that women should be sexual gatekeepers and expect more discipline and self-mastery for men. But in a world where I think a lot of women don’t want to do that, a lot of men are not going to follow that, I think there’s good reason, if we are looking at it from the perspective of their interests, which is I think one of the premises of the book, that we wouldn’t want to say, well, in a moment where that failed or the particular contraception used failed, well, now everything is different. Because I think there isn’t a deep interest people have in being able to live their life in the way they hope to live it. And making those choices as free as possible, as opposed to really constricting one path even as we open maybe with more progressive family policy another, I think will lead to a lot of hardship for folks, maybe some of them who deserve it under a question of virtue but many who don’t, and all of whom are just — human have their failures, just like I constantly do. |  | erika bachiochi |  | Yeah, so really, the book is a push towards seeing how all of that work really underlies our economics, our politics, our civic life and that that’s why we should be focusing on caregiving, because it’s really the most important work that is done. I guess I would say in response is that I think it’s really important that we have high expectations in part because there is a way — I mean, there’s this kind of new antinatalism, this new people deciding ex ante that they never want to become parents. And I think that the cultural push toward that is that we don’t see — we don’t have experiences with as much because of decline in fertility and all that with aunts and uncles, with siblings. And so people don’t realize what they’re missing out on when they make those sorts of determinations well ahead of time. And, as you say, parenting is profound. And I think for eons and eons, what human beings have seen is that becoming a mother or father really develops the person, requires a great movement away from the focus on self toward another, toward what Mary Wollstonecraft saw would be a benevolence and in order to then be able to focus on others outside of your family as well, and that that maturation process, I think, is most definitely needed in our culture right now on the part of both men and women. I have certainly been matured by becoming a mother. I’ve seen that with family members. I’ve seen that with friends. And it’s something that they don’t realize the kind of transformation that they could have put off but now are so grateful that they had. And I think it’s OK and I think it’s actually good for a culture to have these high expectations, that we want mature citizens and that we see the call toward parenting that every generations and generations of basically world history has seen as an important marker of maturity. I just think that that’s a good thing. I would want to see more of it. And I think the kind of quest for autonomy tends to leaves people really empty, tends to leave people literally alone. We have a loneliness epidemic. And I think more children is a good thing. And so helping people who are unexpected in pregnancy, who don’t think that they can handle it, helping them find the resources, whether it’s financial, whether it’s social, whether it’s emotional, civic resources, government resources, et cetera, to kind of be transformed by caring for other people is just a good thing. [MUSIC PLAYING] |  | ezra klein |  | Let’s talk a bit about — holding questions of reproductive law to the side, what you think would make America — what cultural changes and policy changes you think would make America a much friendlier and encouraging environment for people to have families and how to value that work? Because something you say throughout the book that I think is very, very pointed and very true is that the family is not parasitic on the market. The market is parasitic on the family. And we often get that backwards. So what would it mean to value the care work done inside of families at the level that it should be valued? How do you imagine that looking as a society? |  | erika bachiochi |  | So there’s a lot of real heroes in the book. One of the great lines of Jane Addams, who formed Hull House during the time of the Industrial Revolution when there were literally women who were sent into horrible working places, working conditions, and had to leave their children bereft of any care, she had this nice phrase, which I really like, where she talks about how we have to have — well, she didn’t say policies, but I’m going to put it this way — policies that prioritize what she said was the family claim over the social claim. And there was a move toward this, and it was right when I was kind of cutting my teeth — now that you mentioned I was a Bernie supporter. But I was studying sociology, women’s studies, and then moved toward political theory in college. And it was right in the 1990s when the communitarians were pushing back on some of the libertarian family policy economic, or lack of family policy altogether, but economic policy. And there were people from both the left and the right who I started to read a lot — Michael Sandel, Amitai Etzioni and, especially for me, Mary Ann Glendon. And that communitarian movement, from what I understand, was torn apart because of differences of abortion. And so my hope is then kind of in a post-Roe era, that kind of like a communitarian movement could grow back again. And so in their communitarian platform — I can’t remember if this is in the family policy part of it or just the platform itself. But they have this nice line that a responsive community must act to smooth the path for parents so that the joys of family life might be more easily felt and its burdens more fairly borne. And so I think it’s really implicit in the whole of the book that the caring for children and the work of the home is something that all of society benefits from. And yet parents are the ones who take on those sacrifices. And so the idea of spreading costs of child rearing more fully across societies is, I think, a just kind of thing. And so thinking of the market as something that serves families and not just that families serve the market I think is a good way to think about it. So what are some policies that do that? Now, I am not a policy wonk. I would greatly recommend the work of my colleague at Ethics and Public Policy Center, Patrick Brown. I lay out at the very end of my book some policies that I think would be useful, and they’re more sort of principles than actual policies out there. But I think workplace flexibility is a really, really important one and predictable scheduling. I think that upper echelons of workers have this knit into their work and that those who are low-wage workers really — it’s the just-in-time scheduling, where they’re given their schedules barely a week ahead of time and have all sorts of difficult childcare predicaments because of that, that there should really just be a lot more workplace flexibility just as a humane kind of standard. I think that both left and right — and you’re already seeing this in the states — could get behind the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act, which is a move past the Pregnancy Discrimination Act, which is an advance from that requiring reasonable accommodations for pregnant employees. I think there’s just a real important principle. And I think this is where that parents really should not be economically disadvantaged by raising children. I think it’s really important, too, that we not penalize those mothers and fathers who want to have one of them stay home, and pushing for part-time pay equity. So women who are mothers — sometimes this is men who are home — but usually mothers don’t have to pay this mommy tax, where they make disproportionately less just because they’re mothers. I think this is a place where policy is really, really important, that we ought not assume that things like parental leave, which I very much support, should be trying to get women back to the workplace as fast as possible. It should be really a time off and that we should support other things that you support, as well as other types of things like a family allowance. Again, the right is certainly in big discussions about the unintended consequences of decoupling work from that. I would send you to people like Oren Cass at American Compass and Patrick Brown in terms of really getting at the nuts and bolts of Romney’s policy and how that would work. But I think making sure that the work of the home is taken so seriously, is seen as so important that any choice that parents make to stay home should not disproportionately affect them so that policy is only supporting those people who want to put their children in daycare. Obviously, some people do have to put their children in daycare. And the very poor, especially if they’re not able to have one person stay home, then we ought to be helping them with daycare as well. But I think some of those things — we put, as I say in the book, a man on the moon with government priorities. Why aren’t we prioritizing the really important work that takes place in the home? And so those are some of the basic things that I would say. |  | ezra klein |  | In some ways, on the child laws piece particularly, I was surprised you didn’t go even more radical on that, because I think there is a growing movement for a child allowance. We passed one in the American Rescue Plan, which is now expiring unfortunately because Democrats can’t get the votes to extend it. Romney has won, but he doesn’t really have any — or virtually any Republican co-sponsors. But even if you make one of those permanent, I mean, that would be good. But it’s a couple thousand bucks a kid, really. And that’s a far cry from what you make in the workforce. And it’s never struck me as genuinely impossible to imagine a world where people get paid at, say, the local median wage for staying home with a child or get replaced at 80 percent of a previous wage or something like that. A lot of different ways one would have to think about both financing and structuring it. But if this work is so important, you could functionally become a government employee if you could prove that you become a full-time parent. And as somebody who spent a lot of time parenting, I think it’s a lot harder than my job. My job is full of autonomy and finishable tasks, and people tell me I did a good job. And parenting’s much, much tougher. And I’m always struck that I see so few people actually arguing that there should be a true parenting wage. And I think if you passed all those policies, as somebody who believes in all of them, and they’re closer to being true in some places and others, I’m not sure how far they actually get you. To the point of some of the things you say in the book, I think that to get to the genuinely needless structure that you want and that in some ways I want, although with differences around reproductive choice, you have to really, really, really rethink things profoundly. You can’t have this just gigantic endless gap between working and parenting. If parenting is so valuable, then practically a very rich country needs to figure out how to value it. And even the very progressive policies I see right now around child benefits, they don’t. |  | erika bachiochi |  | Yeah. And I think that this is a place where I hope left and right come together, sit down, and work out their differences. Theoretically, I think you’re right, that it does make sense from my perspective to have as much possible remuneration, you would say, for the work of the home. At the same time, though, I don’t want it to be something that becomes akin to a part or a piece or part of the market. So there’s a way in which it ought to be valued apart from the work wage labor in that sense, right? So it’s a tricky thing. But I think one of the other things that I mention is making sure that women who have had children — and, again, this could be again for a man whose home instead — but have stepped out for the labor market don’t suffer the loss of wages. And how do you do that? Well, by making sure that they have no income taxes going forward, that potentially that they earn Social Security benefits. I think that may be a way of doing the same sort of thing in a structure that’s already there. And I know someone who’s an expert on ERISA on retirement benefits who’s working quite hard at figuring out how this would work. So I think there’s all sorts of ways that you do it. And, again, because I don’t have expertise in that area, I’m not all that comfortable weighing in on the exact policies, on the exact numbers. And there’s also kind of the unintended consequences that you don’t want to crowd out the work that fathers need to do. Because of the asymmetrical burdens that women have in childbearing, that men do need to be involved. And part of that involvement is financial provision. And so if the government steps in at such a high rate that men don’t need to be making sure that they’re providing for their children financially — and hopefully when they take seriously that financial obligation, that they start to take seriously that being attentive and the emotional obligation as well. I think that’s really important. And I wouldn’t want to crowd that out. So that’s where there’s a bit of a complication. And I’d want really experts — I’d like to be in the room, but I’d also want real policy experts hashing these things out. And I hope we get to the place where we can do that. |  | ezra klein |  | So then always our final question — what are three books that have influenced you you would recommend to the audience? |  | erika bachiochi |  | So the three books I picked — I mean, I’m sure all of your guests say it’s so difficult to do so. But I decided I would really pick three books that were incredibly formative for me after my time as a women’s studies student at Middlebury College, when I was changing my views about things in a lot of different ways. But I fell upon, again, the communitarian movement and started reading a lot of Mary Ann Glendon’s work. In the book, I argue that she is really the complete and true heir of what I lay out as this Wollstonecraftian vision and so have an entire chapter devoted to her really what I call dignitarian thoughts. I sort of think of her as both a communitarian and a dignitarian. But her book “Rights Talk” was incredibly influential. For those who don’t know her, Mary Ann Glendon is just a newly retired, so now emeritus professor of Harvard Law School. And in that book, she gives a, I think, very evenhanded critique of the libertarian philosophy that’s really at the heart of much thinking on both the left and the right and how there’s kind of a neglect of a real robust American tradition of concern for the vulnerable, the dependent, a tradition of hospitality and the common good. The second book is by historian Elizabeth Fox-Genovese, which is a book called “Feminism Without Illusions.” She is the late founder of the Women’s Studies program at Emory University. In this book, “Feminism Without Illusions,” is a critique of liberal individualism and, again, libertarianism in modern feminism. And the third book is a book by the late University of Chicago political theorist Jean Bethke Elshtain, her book “Public Man, Private Woman.” And in a similar way — although she is diving really deeply into how Western political theorists, starting with Plato and Aristotle and up through, have really thought about man and woman and public life and private life and the relation between them. And it’s really a call at the end there for a revaluation of the work that’s done in the private sphere, as we call it now, and the real attention to the needs of children, especially within feminism. And she concludes — really, incredibly learned book — with this in her last chapter. And I’ll quote. “I’m calling here for redemption of everyday life, a recognition of the joys and vexations, its values and purpose and its place in becoming human.” And I think this is really in some ways — in some really fundamental way the call of my book as well. |  | ezra klein |  | Erika Bachiochi, thank you very much. |  | erika bachiochi |  | Thanks so much for having me, Ezra.

They started with a blank piece of paper. Each person in turn would begin to sketch, slowly building the scene. As Sara and her brother watched, “their father moved his pencil, faint lines that turned — as if by magic — into places and things they recognized.” Suddenly, there it was: an entire world, familiar yet strange, and within it, a story. |  | This, too, is how Nina LaCour, who won a Printz Award for her young adult literature, weaves together her first adult novel. Chapter by chapter, she switches between perspectives to craft a quiet love story about two young women in Southern California who are figuring out what it means to build a home and to choose to invite someone to share in it. |  | The book’s title, which translates to good herb, comes from the native flora of California, and the stories of both characters start there, too: Sara in a redwood grove, finding first love with her best friend amid the ancient trunks, and Emilie in a school garden, seeking refuge from a tumultuous home life in the stalks of verbena and mint. From there, the book hopscotches forward, flashing through Sara and Emilie’s young adulthood a few months at a time and laying a foundation of adolescent trauma that will shape our two protagonists. |  | It takes a while for the story to gain momentum as Sara and Emilie’s lives slowly chug through a collision course toward each other. In the first 100 pages, we encounter death, addiction, sexual abuse, teenage runaways and a litany of other miseries. Many of the themes — of young characters disconnected from community, thrust into the world alone and struggling to build a new version of family and identity — will be familiar to those who have read LaCour’s young adult work, although here the details of these stories, particularly Sara’s, are more explicit, even bordering at times on gratuitous."

She embarks on a daring friendship with Nettleton’s head nurse, the dashing Roberta Nolan — “call me Bertie” — that leads to a romance with a muckraking journalist, Jake Enright. Mary’s future gleams with promise, until she glimpses a familiar face among the Nettleton inmates. Lillian Faust grew up in the same orphanage as Mary and now finds herself milking cows on Vogel’s model farm not because she is feebleminded — she’s the opposite of that — but because she bore a child with a Black man. |  | Mary doesn’t awaken to the corruption at Nettleton in an instant. Her eyes open in flickers, because she is a human being and doesn’t want to see what is inconvenient to her own needs, both materially and spiritually. Vogel’s motherly patronage offers rewards that seduce her compliance. But, as the doctor’s monstrousness reveals itself, Mary enters a baroque psychological dance. The weather turns colder; the mood turns darker. Leary is in full command as the story spirals to the kind of harrowing climax — blizzard raging, phone lines cut — that forces Mary to stake her moral ground. |  | “The Foundling” is Leary’s first historical novel, and she has all the right instincts, by which I mean she inhabits Mary without modern conceit. Yes, the speakeasy slang and the gin fizzes are there, but any competent hack can recreate the sounds and sights of the past. Leary does something more daring — she asks you to root for a protagonist who comes equipped with the orthodoxies of her own day. Engle isn’t some magically enlightened dream girl who sheds the pixie dust of contemporary social justice on the benighted bigots of yesteryear. She is on a journey, as we say, which gives her moment of reckoning its power. If “The Foundling” lacks the sly, delicious wit of Leary’s previous books, it’s only because Leary is such a virtuoso that she doesn’t indulge herself at the expense of Mary’s characterization. |  | Back to the conundrum in the introduction. Our villain’s moral impulses are corrupted by good old-fashioned lust for power, whereas Sanger and most of her fellow eugenicists wanted only to harness science to make the world a better (in their eyes) place. When Leary aligns Dr. Vogel with the forces of cronyism and big business, she may be pointing a finger at her historical inspiration or she may be serving our taste for a familiar bad guy. But Leary is too clever and too honest not to know exactly what she’s doing; “The Foundling” arrests us precisely because its antagonist comes cloaked in the good intentions of progressive social reform. Leary pins her cautionary tale on the portrait of Vogel herself and her iron conviction that she’s doing the right thing. |  | “The end very often justifies the means,” she tells Mary. |  | No revolutionary believes herself to be on the wrong side of history, after all. Book clubs, uncork your bottles."

When approached by Melanie, who is angry that he has agreed to participate in extradition and torture, Bradley refuses to claim responsibility and later rationalizes his role in the suffering of others: “Your country calls. You answer, and seeing the answer through lets you see up close the normally invisible gears turning beneath the surface of the world.” |  | Image |  | Melanie is the most complicated of the four: She lies to her husband and son and yet strives to do right by the white-liberal standards set by her activist friends. The implication is that Melanie must imagine and then empathize with the lives her world has disrupted or destroyed, and yet her empathy is a dead end. She never meets Ayoub or even a man like him, and while her friends are much more determined in their activism and whistle-blowing, Melanie remains in the background of her own story, quietly letting difficult conversations pass her by and second-guessing both her intuitions and actions. While passivity of this kind might be true to life, portraying it like this in fiction — generally and without counterpoint — pulls energy from the narrative at large. |  | In pleasing contrast to the American couple, who seem flattened by their self-delusion, the couple in Rome are brought off the page by their complexity. Baker’s Rome is vivid and gritty, and unrecognizable to the casual tourist. The author is careful to withhold much of Ayoub’s experience, wisely avoiding voyeuristic details of the extradition or torture. Instead, we follow a man who suffers but also seeks a path forward, however narrow and winding. On the first day of his new job at a produce stall, Ayoub “keeps his head up, not seeking eye contact but not avoiding it either, letting people see that he is one of them, with somewhere to go and something to do when he gets there.” This quiet detail of confidence-building, of self-presentation, holds in it the author’s respect for his character, who, like all good characters, is both weak and strong. |  | Image Peter C. Baker Credit... Jonathan Michael Castillo |  | The debate continues over whether imagining the other — writing outside one’s identity with respect and empathy — actually works in fiction. We live in a moment of great reckoning. Amira is an interesting contribution to the conversation.

While the commonwealth does not have an abortion ban on the books, our governor has said that he is “staunchly, unabashedly” against abortion and fully committed to “going on the offense” against abortion rights in our legislature. Should Roe fall, he could well strip women of their reproductive rights — and go after thousands more who flock to the state whenever neighboring jurisdictions clamp down on abortion access. What’s more, in Virginia today women who are suspected of terminating a pregnancy without the assistance of a certified medical professional can face felony charges if they miscarry. |  | So when the court’s draft decision overturning Roe v. Wade was leaked earlier this month, I committed to never prosecute a woman for making her own health care decisions. That means that no matter what the law in Virginia says, I will not prosecute a woman for having an abortion or for being suspected of inducing one. |  | I didn’t make this decision lightly. But I knew my constituents were tired of the empty rhetoric from Democrats in Washington, desperate for action and understandably fearful for their future.

Because of the line’s voltage, the project’s design and suitability did not require more detailed reviews by the commission and other state agencies. |  | Transmission data collected by the U.S. Department of Energy highlights how unusual 161-kilovolt lines are, particularly over long distances. Just 3 percent of all transmission lines in the country are 161 kilovolts, and they average five miles in length, said Mr. McCullough, who reviewed the data. |  | The Public Service Commission, responsible for ensuring that utility investments are prudent and avoid economic waste, declined to comment about the transmission line, its funding or Florida Power & Light’s practices, noting that the rate case could be appealed. |  | The company said it had met its legal and regulatory requirements. |  | “To be blunt, this type of criticism is misguided and demonstrates a fundamental lack of understanding of how the regulatory process works,” said David Reuter, a spokesman for NextEra Energy, which owns the utility. “The unanimous F.P.S.C. decision on FPL’s rate case is the culmination of the customary, transparent, nearly yearlong public process of reviewing and setting new electric base rates.” |  | Richard Gentry, who was named the state’s top consumer advocate early last year after long working as a lobbyist for tobacco, alcohol, horse racing, manufacturing and other industries, said his office had no authority to question a low-voltage transmission project. |  | Mr. Gentry did, however, take part in negotiations regarding the rate case that included the transmission project. The approved rate increase includes a return for the utility that is among the highest in the country and valued at as much as $1 billion more than the state’s two other investor-owned utilities (Duke Energy and Tampa Electric)."

Days after she reported her abuser, he was found dead. The experience was so traumatic that she refused to speak for nearly five years. Finding and sharing words is excruciatingly challenging for all survivors, but especially for children. |  | In her new book, “The Trayvon Generation,” the poet Elizabeth Alexander writes: “For all of us, language is how we say who we are and we cannot solve our problems without it.” Terms like “child molester” are not the only ones fraught with conflict these days, but the stakes with these words are higher than most. The victims are children who cannot fight back. Words, in this case, are the mechanism of action. A child in danger cannot find safety if the language we use to define abuse is diluted. Language is also what helps survivors find some semblance of healing; it’s our only way out. |  | Trauma of any kind, but especially childhood trauma, is splintered and stored in the brain in fragments. The memories are often so overwhelming that they simmer under the surface for years, creating chaos in the body and a sense of unrelenting threat. |  | For me, this manifested as the visceral desire to hide under desks and tables when the television screens in my office broadcast the testimony of gymnasts who had suffered abuse at the hands of Larry Nassar. It appeared as the inability to hear when I was stressed, because of the way my reflexes were trained to block out sound. It appeared as the inability to be in an intimate relationship without panic attacks or dissociation. And it appeared as a chronic and pervading distrust of authority that has followed me ever since. |  | Only in constructing language around my experience could I access help, release myself from a long-harbored and isolating secret, and create a narrative that put the disparate pieces of my trauma back together. I finally have ownership over my experiences, and therefore my life. I can see a future for myself that I once could not, one that is free of harmful physical and emotional reactions and full of meaningful relationships. |  | No anti-LGBTQ education bill, book ban or health care ban, would have prevented my abuse or helped me in its aftermath. What could have helped me was comprehensive sexual education in which I would have been taught age-appropriate language around consent, like “good touch” and “bad touch.” That language would have also helped me understand that what happened to me was wrong and that it was not my fault, ideas that I have grappled with since that day and have still not settled all these years later. |  | One in four girls and one in 13 boys will endure sexual abuse before their 18th birthday.

Though Ukraine’s military industry was important in Soviet times, by 2014 the country barely had a modern military at all. Oligarchs, not the state, armed and funded some of the militias sent to fight Russian-supported separatists in the east. The United States started arming and training Ukraine’s military, hesitantly at first under President Barack Obama. Modern hardware began flowing during the Trump administration, though, and today the country is armed to the teeth. |  | Since 2018, Ukraine has received U.S.-built Javelin antitank missiles, Czech artillery and Turkish Bayraktar drones and other NATO-interoperable weaponry. The United States and Canada have lately sent up-to-date British-designed M777 howitzers that fire GPS-guided Excalibur shells. President Biden just signed into law a $40 billion military aid package. |  | In this light, mockery of Russia’s battlefield performance is misplaced. Russia is not being stymied by a plucky agricultural country a third its size; it is holding its own, at least for now, against NATO’s advanced economic, cyber and battlefield weapons. |  | And this is where Mr. Guaino is correct to accuse the West of sleepwalking. The United States is trying to maintain the fiction that arming one’s allies is not the same thing as participating in combat. |  | In the information age, this distinction is growing more and more artificial. The United States has provided intelligence used to kill Russian generals. It obtained targeting information that helped to sink the Russian Black Sea missile cruiser the Moskva, an incident in which about 40 seamen were killed. |  | And the United States may be playing an even more direct role. There are thousands of foreign fighters in Ukraine. One volunteer spoke to the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation this month of fighting alongside “friends” who “come from the Marines, from the States.” Just as it is easy to cross the line between being a weapons supplier and being a combatant, it is easy to cross the line from waging a proxy war to waging a secret war. |  | In a subtler way, a country trying to fight such a war risks being drawn from partial into full involvement by force of moral reasoning. Perhaps American officials justify exporting weaponry the way they justify budgeting it: It is so powerful that it is dissuasive. The money is well spent because it buys peace. Should bigger guns fail to dissuade, however, they lead to bigger wars."

Florida, led by Republicans, has enacted legislation limiting the kind of social media moderation that sites like Facebook, YouTube and Twitter can do, with supporters saying the sites constrict conservative voices. (A U.S. appeals court recently blocked most aspects of the law.) On the federal level, the Department of Homeland Security recently paused the work of an advisory board on disinformation after a barrage of criticism from conservative lawmakers and free speech advocates that the group could suppress speech. |  | “State and local governments are well situated to reduce harms from dis- and misinformation by providing timely, accurate and trustworthy information,” said Rachel Goodman, a lawyer at Protect Democracy, a nonpartisan advocacy group. “But in order to maintain that trust, they must make clear that they are not engaging in any kind of censorship or surveillance that would raise constitutional concerns.” |  | Connecticut and Colorado officials said that the problem of misinformation had only worsened since 2020 and that without a more concerted push to counteract it, even more voters could lose faith in the integrity of elections.

nytimes,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/05/31/opinion/uvalde-shooting-photos.html,2022-05-31T00:00:00,"There are many examples of photographs that gave history a nudge — sometimes even a vigorous one. Think of the My Lai massacre photographs, of the Abu Ghraib torture photos taken by American troops and of Darnella Frazier’s phone video of George Floyd’s murder. But just as the Till photograph didn’t end Jim Crow, the My Lai images didn’t end the Vietnam War (nor did press reports of the atrocity), the Abu Ghraib photographs didn’t end the Iraq war (or even lead to high-level prosecutions), and the Floyd video didn’t end police brutality. These photographs did support, encourage and strengthen public perceptions, political movements and public debates that were already in play. But none resulted in the kinds of immediate change that their supporters hoped for. When it comes to images, there are few Damascene moments, which is why most photojournalists are modest, if not pessimistic, about the influence of their work. |  | And viewers who look to photographs to effect political change should be careful what they wish for: Formulating political decisions on the basis of images can be treacherous. Photographs of skeletal Somalis dying of hunger — those by James Nachtwey are particularly brutal — were one of the key inspirations for the U.S.-United Nations intervention in Somalia in late 1992; less than one year later, Paul Watson’s horrific photograph of a gleeful crowd dragging an American soldier’s naked corpse contributed to our hasty retreat. (The Somali debacle was a major reason for the Clinton administration’s refusal to respond to the Rwandan genocide the following year.) |  | In 2004, Khalid Mohammed’s photograph of Iraqis in Falluja celebrating beneath the burned, mutilated bodies of American contractors hanging from a bridge resulted in what might be called the anti-Somalia effect: Rather than force a U.S. withdrawal, as some in the crowd had apparently hoped, the image encouraged an embarrassed President George W. Bush to order the Marine invasion of the city and intensify the war. The resulting battle was one of the longest and deadliest of the conflict. In its aftermath, one newspaper described Falluja as a “city of ghosts.” |  | The most vexing political conflicts are the most resistant to photographic interventions — as the Syrian civil war, now in its 11th year, shows. Nilufer Demir’s internationally disseminated photographs of little Aylan Kurdi, a drowned Syrian refugee who washed up on the shores of a Turkish beach, inspired fervent responses of outrage and promises of action in 2015. But outrage proved easier than action, and the plight of Syrian refugees remained pretty much the same. |  | And one might well wonder why the so-called Caesar images — a trove of 55,000 photographs depicting Syrians tortured to death in the prisons of President Bashar al-Assad — had zero political effect. The photographs, which were smuggled out of Syria in 2013 and depict victims of eye gouging, strangulation and starvation, were shown to the U.S. Congress, at the United Nations and to the secretary of state at the time, John Kerry, as well as to other world leaders. Geoffrey Nice, a war crimes prosecutor, described them as akin to “getting the keys to the Nazi archive.” However, as this newspaper reported, “Syrian’s Photos Spur Outrage, but Not Action.” |  | In the case of Uvalde, all of this remains, for the most part, theoretical. It is highly unlikely that the grieving parents would ever consent to the publication of images of their children and equally hard to imagine that the pictures would not circulate on sites that would dishonor, if not defile, the victims. Images of dead children, after all, are different from all others. Children represent both innocence and promise — represent, in fact, our belief in the future. To see them violated elicits instinctual reactions of pity, anger, grief and shame. The question, though, is what we do with that vortex of emotions once it has been unleashed. |  | Despite the very real dangers of exploitation and misuse that disclosure of the Uvalde photographs would pose, I myself would like politicians to view them: to look — really look — at the shattered face of what was previously a child and to then contemplate the bewildered terror of her last moments on earth. But that would not mean that the jig is up. People, not photographs, create political change, which is slow, difficult and unpredictable. Don’t ask images to think, or to act, for you."

The patterns are clear even though the world is a messy place, with many factors other than vaccines influencing Covid death rates. |  | Yet when you look at the data on mask-wearing — both before vaccines were available and after, as well as both in the U.S. and abroad — you struggle to see any patterns. |  | Almost 30 percent |  | The idea that masks work better than mask mandates seems to defy logic.

The squeeze hitting consumers comes at a tough time for the White House and Democrats, as the November midterm elections approach and voters cite inflation and the cost of living as top economic concerns. |  | Mr. Biden has consistently struck a far more optimistic tone than the broader public on the economy, stressing month after month of rapid job growth — and an ensuing drop in the unemployment rate — as the country recovers from the pandemic recession. |  | After more than a year of watching inflation rise faster than his economic advisers projected, the president in recent weeks has attempted to convey more urgency with his comments on inflation, promising to do everything in his power to slow rising costs. |  | Top economic officials in the administration fanned out across cable news programs and the White House briefing room on Tuesday to hammer the message that job growth has rebounded strongly and that the economy is transitioning to a more stable growth rate — and to lower inflation. |  | Mr. Biden “understands that right now the top issue on people’s minds is prices — prices at the gas station, prices at the grocery store,” Brian Deese, who heads the White House National Economic Council, told reporters on Tuesday. “And he’s made very clear, and he’s communicating very clearly, that that’s his top economic priority and that we can address this from a position of strength.” |  | Inflation F.A.Q. Card 1 of 5 What is inflation? Inflation is a loss of purchasing power over time, meaning your dollar will not go as far tomorrow as it did today. It is typically expressed as the annual change in prices for everyday goods and services such as food, furniture, apparel, transportation and toys. What causes inflation? It can be the result of rising consumer demand. But inflation can also rise and fall based on developments that have little to do with economic conditions, such as limited oil production and supply chain problems. Is inflation bad? It depends on the circumstances. Fast price increases spell trouble, but moderate price gains can lead to higher wages and job growth. How does inflation affect the poor? Inflation can be especially hard to shoulder for poor households because they spend a bigger chunk of their budgets on necessities like food, housing and gas. Can inflation affect the stock market? Rapid inflation typically spells trouble for stocks. Financial assets in general have historically fared badly during inflation booms, while tangible assets like houses have held their value better. |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  | Mr. Biden stressed those points in a Wall Street Journal opinion piece published online Monday evening, in which he stressed wealth gains for typical Americans on his watch and said the United States was “in a better economic position than almost any other country.” He promised to fight inflation by reducing the federal budget deficit, working to repair broken global supply chains, passing legislation to reduce energy costs for families and relying on the Fed."

Putin, and his brand of nationalism, expressing sympathies for Mr. Putin’s security demands to NATO. He has also painted Hungary’s interests as being distinct from the West by fanning culture wars and fears of liberal values lapping at Hungary’s borders, speaking in March about “the gender insanity sweeping across the Western world.”"

The agreement, which was reached after weeks of wrangling among E.U. member states, could cut into Moscow’s ability to finance its invasion of Ukraine. The embargo applies to most oil imports from Russia. |  | The key word in the sanctions package is “most,” Geordie Wilkes, the head of research at Sucden Financial, told DealBook. “There’s no doubt that the whole sanctions package and this latest move from the E.U. will hurt Russia,” he said. How much it hurts will depend on Russia’s ability to find other buyers — and how much “most” turns out to be, Wilkes said. The deal includes a temporary exemption for oil via pipelines. |  | The embargo could drive already high oil prices even higher. That’s because it will put a further strain on inventories, which are already low and are likely to stay that way, given China’s expected easing of coronavirus lockdown measures and summertime demand for more power for air-conditioners, Wilkes said. The push for cleaner energy has meant that companies have not been investing in new equipment to bolster production, and this could further hurt supplies in the longer term, he said. Futures for Brent crude, the global benchmark, rose to a two-month high of around $120 a barrel today. |  | In the short term, Russia will most likely have no problem continuing to find buyers for its oil. Buyers in India and China, the world’s biggest oil importer, are already snapping up Russian crude at bargain prices, and flows to these countries are likely to increase, analysts said. The damage of sanctions to Russia’s bottom line has been cushioned by persistently high oil prices."

Here’s a lightly edited excerpt from our conversation, which took place on Memorial Day after his emergency room shift: |  | Just a couple of weeks ago, California had a mass shooting. By what measures are our policies a success? |  | You have to look at it on a population basis. We do have more mass shootings in California, but we’re also by far the largest state. I looked a while ago at the rates of firearm violence across the 21st century — homicide and suicide together — and the rest of the country was up, but California’s rates were so far down that the average was flat. |  | We always hear that nothing works, that even California’s strict gun laws are ineffective. |  | That’s because we evaluate policies one at a time, in isolation. The results for one policy might be mixed or even negative. But what California has done over a number of decades has been to enact a whole bundle of policies that I think work in synergy, to measurable effect. |  | It sounds like the “Swiss cheese model” public health experts have used to address Covid. |  | Yes. The idea is to prevent the holes in the policies from lining up. But if we rank the states, California’s rate of firearm violence ranks 29th out of 50 states for homicides and 44th for suicides. |  | Can you share some examples? |  | California has done a lot to prevent high-risk people from purchasing firearms. We’ve broadened the criteria for keeping guns out of the hands of people who pose a danger to themselves or others due to mental illness. If you’re convicted of a violent misdemeanor in California, you can’t have a gun for the next 10 years; that offense has to be a felony in most states."

The alleged incidents date from March 2005, August 2008 and April 2013. During those years, Mr. Spacey was the artistic director of the Old Vic theater in London. All the incidents occurred in London, except one from 2013, which occurred in Gloucestershire, England.

Mr. Spacey is currently defending himself in a lawsuit filed by Mr. Rapp in New York. |  | After Mr. Rapp’s allegations were made public in a BuzzFeed article, 20 people who worked with Mr. Spacey at the Old Vic theater in London, where he was artistic director for 11 years, accused him of inappropriate behavior. The theater, which said last week that it could not comment on ongoing criminal proceedings, commissioned an independent investigation, which Mr. Spacey did not take part in, and issued a report that concluded that “his stardom and status at the Old Vic may have prevented people, and in particular junior staff or young actors, from feeling that they could speak up or raise a hand for help.”"

She fished from the pot what looked like the bent length of drainpipe found under a sink and, with the proud smile of a host presenting the most sought-after portion to a guest, laid it on my plate. It was the entire neck of the chicken. My polite smile became a real one after I began to pull the tender strands of dark meat from the bones and eat them with torn patches of whole-grain khobz, a low-rising bread that is the perfect thing for drinking up the juices of a tagine. |  | In two weeks traveling through Morocco, I never ate anything more delicious than that chicken neck, although it was equaled a few nights later by a lamb and quince tagine cooked by the same woman. Neither tagine, though, was prepared in an actual tagine, the two-piece clay vessel that shares its name with the fragrantly spiced stews that are its main product. If my hosts owned one of those, I never saw it. When tagine was on the menu, it was made in a wide aluminum pot."

To protect them, geriatricians called on nursing homes to organize in-home vaccinations or mandate additional shots. |  | In the longer term, scientists said that policymakers needed to address the economic and medical ills that have affected especially nonwhite older Americans, lest Covid continue cutting so many of their lives short. |  | “I don’t think we should treat the premature death of older adults as a means of ending the pandemic,” Dr. Stokes said. “There are still plenty of susceptible older adults — living with comorbid conditions or living in multigenerational households — who are highly vulnerable.” |  | The pattern of Covid deaths this year has recreated the dynamics from 2020 — before vaccines were introduced, when the virus killed older Americans at markedly higher rates. Early in the pandemic, mortality rates steadily climbed with each extra year of age, Dr. Stokes and his collaborators found in a recent study. |  | That changed last summer and fall, during the Delta surge. Older people were getting vaccinated more quickly than other groups: By November, the vaccination rate in Americans 65 and older was roughly 20 percentage points higher than that of those in their 40s. And critically, those older Americans had received vaccines relatively recently, leaving them with strong levels of residual protection. |  | As a result, older people suffered from Covid at lower rates than they had been before vaccines became available. Among people 85 and older, the death rate last fall was roughly 75 percent lower than it had been in the winter of 2020, Dr. Stokes’s recent study found. |  | At the same time, the virus walloped younger and less vaccinated Americans, many of whom were also returning to in-person work. Death rates for white people in their late 30s more than tripled last fall compared to the previous winter. Death rates for Black people in the same age group more than doubled."

The scheme, Mr. Durham implied, involved the Clinton campaign; its opposition research firm, Fusion GPS; Mr. Sussmann; and the cybersecurity expert who had brought the odd data and analysis to him. |  | That insinuation thrilled Mr. Trump’s supporters, who have embraced his claim that the Russia investigation was a “hoax” and have sought to conflate the official inquiry with sometimes dubious accusations. In reality, the Alfa Bank matter was a sideshow: The F.B.I. had already opened its inquiry on other grounds before Mr. Sussmann passed on the tip; the final report by the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, made no mention of the Alfa Bank suspicions. |  | But the case Mr. Durham and his team used to float their broad insinuations was thin: one count of making a false statement in a meeting with no other witnesses. In a rebuke to Mr. Durham; the lead lawyer on the trial team, Andrew DeFilippis; and his colleagues, the 12 jurors voted unanimously to find Mr. Sussmann not guilty. |  | Some supporters of Mr. Trump had been bracing for that outcome. They pointed to the District of Columbia’s reputation as a heavily Democratic area and suggested that a jury might be politically biased against a Trump-era prosecutor trying to convict a defendant who was working for the Clinton campaign. |  | The judge had told the jurors that they were not to account for their political views when deciding the facts.

nytimes,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/05/31/climate/alaska-climate-politics.html,2022-05-31T00:00:00,"There are other long-running environmental conflicts in Alaska as well. Among them is the dispute over oil drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, which has simmered since the 1970s, and the fight over the Ambler Road, a proposal for a 210-mile mine-access road, part of which would run through Gates of the Arctic National Park. The project is a relative newcomer, having been first proposed in the 2000s. |  | Clearly, environmental disputes in Alaska are in a league of their own. The reasons are complex, but here’s a quick basic look at some of them. |  | There’s a lot of environment to fight over. Alaska is a behemoth, and aside from the Anchorage area, Fairbanks and Juneau, still largely undeveloped, with more wilderness by far than any other state. The law at the center of the King Cove dispute, for instance, in one fell swoop provided protection for 104 million acres of land. That’s an area the size of California, and nearly 5 percent of the total land area of the United States. |  | There are a lot of resources to fight over, too. The metals that the Pebble Mine would extract are estimated to be worth $300 billion. The commercial salmon fishery that opponents say the mine would harm generates about $2 billion in economic benefits a year, according to a recent report. These are just two examples the state’s richness in resources. Oil is another, with tens of billions of barrels already produced and billions more thought to be present in places like the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. |  | It’s not just environmentalists vs. business interests. Another seminal piece of federal legislation, the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act of 1971, was an effort to treat Indigenous peoples in the state more justly than they were treated in the Lower 48 under the reservation system. In return for giving up aboriginal claims to Alaska’s land, the act established for-profit Native corporations, both regional and local, and transferred about 40 million acres of land to them. Native corporations are everywhere in the state, and thus have been involved in many of the environmental fights, on both sides. In the King Cove road dispute, for example, the local Native corporation wants the road, arguing that it is needed for medical emergencies. But some Native corporations elsewhere are against it, concerned that by going through the wildlife refuge the road would affect populations of migratory geese that their members have traditionally hunted for food."

nytimes,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/05/31/books/review/adriatic-robert-d-kaplan.html,2022-05-31T00:00:00,"Speaking of specters, the second half of this work evokes the spirit of Kaplan’s famous “Balkan Ghosts: A Journey Through History” (1993), which covered much of the same geography. “Balkan Ghosts” received a great deal of acclaim worldwide but was less warmly received by professional historians. Among the latter, Kaplan singles out Noel Malcolm, who “wrote a devastatingly harsh review” because “Balkan Ghosts” “did not come remotely close to meeting Malcolm’s standards of objectivity and research.” But “my initial rage over the review gave way over time to a deliberate resolve to learn from such criticism.” Elsewhere, he writes: “I silently determined to henceforth explore also the best works of academia, in both history and political science.” True to his word, Kaplan employs Malcolm’s own scholarly study of the Bruni and Bruti families of the 16th century (“Agents of Empire”). |  | But if many academic historians have been critical of Kaplan, he exhibits nothing but admiration for the best of them. “How I regret not continuing my education beyond college and toward a Ph.D. … I would have wanted to dig deep and narrowly like an archaeologist, in order to illuminate something both profound and panoramic.” The historical scope of Kaplan’s canvas is vast, yet he works hard to bring to it the fruits of modern historical scholarship. That is rare among popular authors, and deserves much praise. |  | In my view, as an academic and a specialist on medieval and early modern Venice, Kaplan has gone a long way toward achieving his goal. Academic history is hard — often written in precise and specialized terms for other historians. Undaunted, Kaplan brings to his reader (in digestible forms) scholars like Peter Brown, Norman Davies, Deborah Deliyannis, Peter Frankopan, Judith Herrin, Frederic Lane, Philip Mansel, Francis Oakley, Chris Wickham and others. They enrich his narrative and enliven his descriptions. |  | And yet. Kaplan’s personal affinity for the Balkans produces a noticeable blind spot when it comes to Venice. With few exceptions, all the destinations in this book were once part of Venice’s maritime empire. Venetian architecture, especially in Dalmatia and Corfu, is described yet its implications are not. While Kaplan is certainly correct that “the bulk of output in the humanities is notoriously spoiled by jargon,” there remains a prodigious amount of serious modern scholarship on Venice and its Stato da Mar. It is unconsidered here. Instead, Kaplan relies on older works by Mary McCarthy, John Julius Norwich and Jan Morris. Had he, during his sojourn in Venice, peeked into the State Archives at the Frari or the Marciana Library on the Piazzetta San Marco, Kaplan would have discovered a hive of international scholars digging into the fascinating and complex history of this unique republic. Without those insights, Kaplan’s medieval Venetians are flat, lifeless and too easily defined. “Pragmatism, of both the ruthless and the enlightened variety, was the guiding spirit of medieval Venice.” Really? Can any people, particularly one as diverse as the Venetians, be so summarily dismissed? Realism, Kaplan reports, “was the one true religion of Venice.” Why then did they build over a hundred churches and monasteries? This is one part of the famous “anti-myth” of Venice, that the conniving Venetians were a nation of Shylocks ever demanding their pound of flesh."

Tell us about them in the comments section. |  | After almost three years on hiatus, Netflix brought subscribers back to the world of “Stranger Things” with the first seven episodes of Season 4, which dropped on Friday.

Once again, its creators, the Duffer Brothers, frolic in a nostalgic sandbox of references to the pop culture of the time in which it’s set, which is now early 1986. |  | Below, we gathered many of the major Season 4 talking points, but we’re leaving out some foundational texts by Stephen King, Steven Spielberg, John Hughes and John Carpenter, which have been endlessly identified and discussed with earlier seasons.

So pour yourself a Tab, fire up your dial-up modem, and have a look. |  | ‘Alien 3’ |  | The show has used the “Alien” films as an influence since the beginning, and it extends some of that love to the much-maligned 1992 David Fincher entry by taking its hero all the way to a far-off prison that just happens to have something like an alien, too. David Harbour has name-dropped “Alien 3” as an influence on his arc this season, and when Hopper is trying to rally other bald inmates to battle a deadly creature, it’s hard not to imagine Sigourney Weaver’s Ripley in the same role. The influential artist H.R. Giger and the films that turned his creature into nightmare fuel will likely be an influence to the end, but one has to wonder how they’ll find a way to incorporate “Alien: Resurrection” into Season 5.

Rotten — who now goes by his real name, John Lydon — was one of the pioneers of London’s 1970s punk movement, known for his “divine insanity,” as John Rockwell wrote in The New York Times in 1977, and for overseeing concerts where chairs were thrown and noses bloodied. |  | “Pistol” — which begins streaming Tuesday on Hulu in the United States and on Disney+ in other territories — is Boon’s most significant screen role to date, following parts onstage in London and in films like Sam Mendes’s “1917.”"

nytimes,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/05/31/opinion/ukraine-energy-war-europe-gas.html,2022-05-31T00:00:00,"At the more macro level, we’re all still commending one another for the unity that this crisis has brought both within Europe and in the trans-Atlantic community. But there are little cleavages emerging, between East European countries and West European countries, with the East European countries — the Baltics and Poland — saying, why are you guys so slow? Why aren’t you tougher on Russia? And countries like Germany were saying, look, if we cut off gas, it’s 400,000 lost German jobs. |  | On the trans-Atlantic side, we could be moving into a new period. I think as this progresses and as Europe bears more and more of the costs of this, with the United States looking to be more and more the beneficiary — because of the huge quantities of natural gas it will be selling to Europe — that we’re going to be tougher on Russia than the Europeans are going to be. And if there’s a negotiation, the United States will want to keep sanctions on longer than the Europeans are going to want to. |  | The European Commission recently released a proposal for Europe to cut its dependency on Russian gas by two-thirds by the end of this year. Is that plausible, do you think? When I saw those numbers I thought, first, two-thirds is an awful lot to cut, and second, that still leaves one-third, which is still plenty of leverage, especially at the end of the year heading right into winter. |  | BORDOFF: I think it’s a very ambitious goal. It will be hard to achieve. And if the Russian gas supply were cut off by the end of the year, I think that would be more economically painful than some recognize. You’d be talking about needing to make plans for how to ration energy. Governments would need to be having those conversations now — and they are. |  | The second thing I would say is that half of that two-thirds reduction is supposed to come from imports of liquid natural gas. And there’s not that much extra LNG you can sort of ramp up and put in the market. So if it’s coming into Europe, it’s not going somewhere else. That’s why China’s planning to increase coal production by 300 million tons, and coal prices are already at incredibly high levels. And Asia’s going to be using more coal, and emerging markets and developing economies are really struggling to make it through the hot summer, made worse, as your book reminded us, by climate change. Typically, they rely on cheap coal for that, but there is no cheap coal anymore, and that all feeds into the food crisis and all the rest. So these things are all kind of interlinked in really worrisome ways. |  | O’SULLIVAN: The International Energy Agency put out its own report back in March, a 10-point plan for how to reduce reliance on Russian gas. It indicates that Europe can get off of a bit more than half of the Russian imports of gas right now but there’s a certain segment it will be exceptionally hard to do. |  | And then there’s the question of how clean or green doing that would be. |  | O’SULLIVAN: According to the I.E.A., roughly half of what Europe might do in the short term is actually consistent with its climate goals — these are things Europe wants to do already, and the war is just hastening the process. And then the rest of what can be done immediately is actually contrary to its climate goals — like a lot of bringing in new coal."

Zverev, beaten by Alcaraz in the Madrid Open final ahead of the French Open, was the more consistent and convincing player for nearly three sets. “I think letting him go ahead in the match and letting him get the confidence was going to be a very difficult thing for me to come back from,” Zverev said. |  | But Alcaraz, on the brink of being quickly eliminated, did lift his game.

Tracy passes the competency test with flying colors; but nobody wants her to move up the ladder. |  | Why? That was the question that propelled “Election.” Tracy was hardly a threat to the high school food chain. She was lonely and insecure, plagued by stomach issues and insomnia.

Some national security officials in the Biden administration say they are concerned that if negotiations between Ukraine and Russia begin, there would be no way to offer significant sanctions relief to Moscow once the reserves have been drained from its overseas accounts. |  | Treasury officials suggested before Ms. Yellen’s comments that the United States had not settled on a firm position about the fate of the assets. Several senior officials, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal debates in the Biden administration, suggested that no final decision had been made. One official said that while seizing the funds to pay for reconstruction would be satisfying and warranted, the precedent it would set — and its potential effect on the United States’ status as the world’s safest place to leave assets — was a deep concern. |  | In explaining Ms. Yellen’s comments, a Treasury spokeswoman pointed to the International Emergency Economic Powers Act of 1977, which says that the United States can confiscate foreign property if the president determines that the country is under attack or “engaged in armed hostilities.” |  | Legal scholars have expressed differing views about that reading of the law. |  | Laurence H. Tribe, an emeritus law professor at Harvard University, argues that the International Emergency Economic Powers Act gives the president ample authority to freeze and seize Russia’s central bank assets. Even if that were in doubt, he said, an amendment to the law that passed after the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks gives the president broader discretion to determine if a foreign threat warrants confiscation of assets. President Biden could cite Russian cyberattacks against the United States to justify liquidating the central bank reserves, Mr. Tribe said, adding that the Treasury Department was misreading the law."

Then, as I got older, I started looking more to growing my own food, especially because I couldn’t find anything here that I was accustomed to eating. At my old apartment, there wasn’t room to grow anything except in containers. And then a co-worker of mine offered me some rows in her garden. It was always difficult to find room in the city. If I’m having this problem, then other people are having this problem. The food insecurity, you have to look at it like food injustice. |  | What nontraditional vegetables do you grow and why? |  | Vegetables like okra and other varieties that I don’t see here. With climate change, I’ve started growing items that aren’t zoned for our area, like bitter melon, which is more of an Asian/Indian gourd. It’s zoned for a 9, which is more tropical, and Iowa is zoned at a 5. I sold the bitter melon gourd at the farmers’ market. All my stuff was sold in two hours. It was really an eye-opener, because people are looking for different foods. A woman from India came up to me at the farmers’ market and had her granddaughter ask me about okra. I talked to them about how I like to cook okra and make it crispy. I thought to myself, “Isn’t this something? This woman doesn’t speak English, but we came together on this.” I think people forget that our demographics change. |  | How can urban farming help solve food deserts — those areas with limited access to affordable and nutritious food? |  | It will provide access to those fruits and vegetables not always readily available. Economicswise, a package of lettuce seeds is $1, $2, but look how much more you get from it. Similarly, if you plant onions, garlic, anything, it’s readily available. Sometimes it’s not that people don’t want to feed their family healthily; it comes down to economic choices.

In every culture she experienced — be it the open-air community atmosphere in Buenos Aires; the new Vegas-like intensity in Dubai, United Arab Emirates; or the joie de vivre spirit of liberation in São Paulo, Brazil — she embraced the thought that “every day we make a choice about how we want to live. Craft your life however you want it. To settle otherwise is a waste of a life.” |  | Since then, Ms. Mariani has transitioned to teaching private school students in Brevard County, Fla. She reflects on her experience in and out of the international teaching world, especially her time in Dubai, in this interview, which has been edited and condensed. |  | When did you decide that you wanted to go into teaching? |  | Teaching wasn’t something I planned to do. When I studied literature in college, I never asked myself what I was going to do with it. In my early 20s, I was bartending, sneaking into the 1996 Olympics, quite directionless. When I decided to go into a teaching program, it was organic. Generally, that is how things work out. You stumble upon something, say, “That’s a good idea. I’ll pursue that and see if I like it.” I appreciate that a lot of life is luck. It’s showing up. Being present. |  | You seem very influenced by Dubai. Why did it affect you? |  | I loved the graciousness in my Emirati students and their parents, with being invited to their homes. It was something I never experienced in the United States. We don’t perhaps build community as a cornerstone of our society like some other cultures do. |  | The politics of Dubai went against my base instincts. I believe in democracy, female autonomy and not politicizing the expression of identity. I had to accept that I’d chosen to live in a culture where my values might not align, but it didn’t mean that I couldn’t be in a classroom full of students and show them the kindness and compassion, and more, that supported my value system."

It’s also hard for us to compete with local people for factory jobs, since we don’t have a hukou [A hukou is a registration system in China identifying a person’s “permanent residence.” For migrants like Mr. Wang, applying for a Shanghai hukou is often an impossibly difficult process.

We were taken in by the Tuma farmer family. Being considered Jewish, I wasn’t allowed to attend school. My mother worked in the fields. My great-grandfather fed the animals wearing his only clothing, a three-piece suit. Jews were required to wear the Star of David. I became best friends with my great-grandfather, but in April 1942 I found him standing with a suitcase. He said “I’m just going on a short vacation.” We took him to the train station and never saw him again. He was taken to Terezin and later murdered at Treblinka [both concentration camps]. I was hidden for the last year and a half of the war, after my mother was taken away to a slave labor camp. The Tumas, Ms. Tuma particularly, hid me when the Nazis came looking for me. |  | Please tell me about Ms. Tuma. |  | She was Catholic. She was my savior. I have a painting of her in a native dress. I look at it and thank her every day. |  | What happened after the war? |  | My mother returned to the farm, and two days later my father rode in on a motorcycle wearing his British Army uniform. It was the happiest day of my life. The saddest part is we were the only survivors. We lost 25 family members. We moved back to Prague, and in January 1948 the Communists took over and named my parents enemies of the state. In February 1948 my father paid people to smuggle us out. A farmer took us to the edge of a forest and said, “Start walking, and if they don’t shoot you first, you’ll be in the U.S. zone of Germany.” After 15 months in refugee camps, we got visas for the U.S. |  | What was life like in New Jersey? |  | I spoke two “words” of English — “sank you.” My father gave some edicts: “I want you to become completely Americanized; I want you to forget everything that happened on the other side of the Atlantic; within 12 months, I want you to speak English without an accent.” I fell in love with basketball, and got a scholarship to Oklahoma State. |  | How has being a childhood survivor shaped your adult life? |  | War shaped my life in lots of ways. I became more pessimistic. I worry. As much as I’ve lightened up, I always see the worst. I still don’t know a lot about the Jewish religion, but I probably admire Jews more than any other group for what they’ve done in science, humanities, all of these things. If I watch a ballgame on TV and see a Jewish name, I’m immediately rooting for that person. I feel like I have a Jewish soul.

There are a lot of climate targets for 2030 or 2050, but things need to change now. It’s this thought that we just have to keep the lights on right now, but we also need to transition away from diesel as 100 percent of the territory’s electricity. |  | Have you watched the movie “Don’t Look Up”? What are your thoughts? |  | I did. When I first got involved in climate justice, the dialogue was mostly “Here are all the terrible things that are happening,” and I felt that from the film.

Weeks later, after the Japanese surrender, the American Seventh Fleet sailed into Shanghai to begin what turned out to be a freewheeling, if relatively brief, interregnum before revolutionary Communist forces took control. |  | By the late 1940s, as the inevitability of Mao Zedong’s victory over the ruling Kuomintang became unmistakable, hostility toward foreigners increased. And in December 1948, the Abish family sailed for the newly created state of Israel, circumnavigating Africa and reaching Israel by way of the Mediterranean Sea to avoid a perilous passage through the Suez Canal. |  | He traces this period in his memoir, a narrative mapped out on two intermingled tracks with chapters titled “The Writer-to-Be” and “The Writer.” |  | “It’s a book about the making of a writer,” he observed in his interview with Tablet. |  | Mr. Abish portrayed his years in Israel as part of his literary evolution, recalling his time as a reluctant young conscript in an army tank unit and subsequently as a librarian at the American Library, run by the now-defunct United States Information Agency. |  | “Is it inevitable that the writer-to-be, variable, inconstant, even disloyal when it comes to obtaining an idea for a story, will view his former friends and lovers as potential material for a future text,” he writes in a passage about a woman he called Allison.

And, he added, even if doctors and patients know there are F.D.A. approved drugs, many think they are “unsafe or not well studied and that everyone regains their weight.” |  | The medical system bears much of the blame, Dr. Stanford said.

In 1977, 22 years after he started his personal management agency and two years after his thriving company established a subsidiary called International Creative Management, which became an industry giant, a newspaper headline neatly summed up his reach: “Want to Make a Million? Hire Marvin Josephson.” |  | He died at 95 on May 17 at his home in Manhattan. His daughter Nancy Josephson said the cause was complications of pneumonia. |  | In a field where Michael Ovitz and other super-agents became almost as famous as the people they represented, Mr. Josephson kept an aggressively low profile. In 1991, when Newsday published a profile of him, he agreed to provide a photograph to go with it only if the article specified that he had declined to be interviewed in depth for the piece."

Even with the exemption to Hungary, the measure will cost the Kremlin billions of dollars a year in revenue while also strategically decoupling Europe from Russia in a lasting way. |  | “We want to stop the Russian war machine and stop the financing of this Russian military capacity by implementing sanctions which aim to put pressure on the Kremlin,” Charles Michel, president of the European Council, said after the deal was announced. |  | Exporting crude is a cornerstone of the Russian economy, and analysts say that the embargo will bruise the industry. So far, Russia’s oil sector has been quite resilient because it sells its crude at about $30 less per barrel than Brent crude. Buyers from Europe and elsewhere have snapped up the opportunity for savings. |  | Kpler, a firm that tracks petroleum shipping, estimates that oil production in Russia actually edged up by about 200,000 barrels a day from April to May, to 10.2 million barrels a day. Still, that was about 800,000 barrels a day below February levels. |  | Kpler anticipates that the E.U. embargo could cause Russian production to drop one million barrels a day, or about 10 percent, once the restrictions come into effect by the end of the year."

It was the product of delicate coalition politics — more than 120 meetings across more than 100 hours, according to the White House. |  | But all of that balancing work, which earned praise from groups as disparate as the N.A.A.C.P., the A.C.L.U. and the Fraternal Order of Police, masked an enduring divide among Democrats that the massacre of 19 children and two teachers in Uvalde, Texas, has ripped back open: Should America invest more in its police or redirect funding and attention elsewhere? |  | Where consensus on the left breaks down |  | When it comes to how to protect children in schools, the national debate bears many hallmarks of the country’s disagreements over policing, and falls into many of the same ruts."

Russia is no longer part of any European peace order.” There’s been “a complete loss of trust with Putin.” |  | Is there any wonder why? Putin’s army is systematically destroying Ukrainian cities and infrastructure with the seeming intent not to impose Russian rule on these towns, communities and farms but rather to erase them and their residents from the map and make true by force Putin’s crackpot claim that Ukraine is not a real country. |  | At the Davos World Economic Forum last week, I interviewed Anatoliy Fedoruk, the mayor of Bucha, Ukraine, the town where Russia stands accused of murdering scores of civilians and leaving their bodies on the streets to rot, or piled into a mass grave in a churchyard, before the Russian troops were driven out. |  | “We had 419 peaceful citizens murdered in multiple ways,” Fedoruk told me. “We had no military infrastructure in our town. People were defenseless. The Russian soldiers stole, they raped and they drank. … I am really surprised that this is happening in the 21st century.” |  | If that was the “shock” phase of this war — and it is still going on — the “awe” phase is something I detected among European officials in Davos and Berlin. To put it bluntly, while the United States of America seems to be coming apart, the United States of Europe — the 27 members of the European Union — have stunned everyone, and most of all themselves, by coming together to make a fist, along with a number of other European nations and NATO, to stymie Putin’s invasion. |  | You could almost feel E.U. officials saying: “Wow, did we make that fist? Is that our fist?” |  | Since February, the E.U. has imposed five packages of sanctions against Russia — sanctions that not only badly hurt Russia but are also costly for the E.U. countries in terms of lost business or higher raw material costs. A sixth package, agreed to on Monday, will cut some 90 percent of E.U. oil imports from Russia by the end of this year while also ejecting Sberbank, Russia’s biggest bank, from SWIFT, the vital global banking messaging system. |  | Maybe the most impressive thing is how many Ukrainian refugees E.U. nations have been willing to house without much complaint. There is an awareness that Ukrainian menfolk are fighting to defend them, too, so the E.U. nations can at least house their women, children and elderly."

A new study revealed something unexpected about those sea grasses: Many of them are the same individual plant that has been cloning itself for about 4,500 years. |  | The sea grass — not to be confused with seaweed, which is an algae — is Poseidon’s ribbon weed, or Posidonia australis. Jane Edgeloe, a University of Western Australia Ph.D. candidate and an author of the paper, likens its appearance to a spring onion. |  | Ms. Edgeloe and her colleagues made their discovery as part of a genetic survey of Posidonia grasses in different areas of Shark Bay, where she SCUBA dived in the shallow waters and pulled up shoots of Posidonia from 10 different meadows. On land, the researchers analyzed and compared the grasses’ DNA. |  | They published their results Wednesday in the journal Proceedings of the Royal Society B. It turned out the DNA of many of those seemingly different plants was virtually identical. Elizabeth Sinclair, also of the University of Western Australia and an author of the study, recalled excitement in the lab when she realized: “It’s only one plant.”"

The case shook New Jersey political circles and has confounded friends and relatives in the years since. |  | The new investigation was first reported on Tuesday by WNYC, which has aired a podcast focused on the Sheridans’ deaths in September 2014 and damning gaps in the initial inquiry. |  | The Somerset County prosecutor’s office initially concluded that Mr. Sheridan, 72, had killed himself and his wife of 47 years.

There is now a statue of Nadal near the entrance of the stadium complex, and throughout Tuesday evening there were chants of “Rafa” even as Djokovic prepared to serve at critical phases. |  | “I think probably they know that I am not going to be here a lot more times,” Nadal said. |  | It was Djokovic who did not get the chance to play in this year’s Australian Open. He was deported on the eve of the competition after a standoff with the Australian government over his being unvaccinated against Covid-19. But he arrived in Paris and at Tuesday’s match in more convincing form than Nadal, who is without a doubt the greatest men’s clay-court player in history but was very short on matches on the surface this year. |  | “Yes, I was surprised by my level tonight,” Nadal said. “But in a way it makes it simpler when you know that you either need your A game or you’re going home.” |  | Nadal injured his ribs at the BNP Paribas Open in Indian Wells, Calif., in March, losing the final to the American Taylor Fritz while playing with a stress fracture. He missed most of the early clay-court season and only returned for the Madrid Open in mid-May, when he was upset by his 19-year-old Spaniard compatriot, Carlos Alcaraz, in the quarterfinals. |  | Then came the Italian Open, his only other clay-court event before Roland Garros, where Nadal was beaten in three sets by Denis Shapovalov of Canada in a round-of-16 night match in Rome in which he hobbled to the finish, grimacing in pain as his chronic left foot condition resurfaced. He was downbeat after that defeat but did not rule out playing in the French Open and arrived in Paris seeded fifth and, unlike in Rome, with his longtime physician, Angel Ruiz-Cotorro. |  | “Having the doctor here you can do things that help,” said Nadal, declining to go into detail on his treatment while continuing to suggest that this could be his final appearance at Roland Garros. “I am putting everything that I have to try to play this tournament with the best conditions possible, no? I don’t know what can happen after, honestly, but here I think I am going to be fine.” |  | As so often, Nadal has proved able to play and prevail through the pain. He fought to a five-set victory in the fourth round over the 21-year-old Canadian Felix Auger-Aliassime, then took on the top-seeded Djokovic for the 59th time on tour and the 10th time at Roland Garros."

It delights in cartoon mobsters and cares not a whit for hipness — unlike, say, “& Juliet,” the West End jukebox musical that imagines a different fate for Romeo’s beloved, or “Fat Ham,” James Ijames’s Pulitzer Prize-winning “Hamlet” reclamation at the Public Theater, both of which have a much higher glamour quotient. |  | With “music adapted from classic Italian melodies,” as the program credit puts it (many of the tunes are by Francesco Paolo Tosti; music direction is by Aaron Gandy), and witty period costumes (by Joseph Shrope), “Romeo & Bernadette” feels fond, familiar, escapist: theater as merry comfort food. The appeal of that — especially in this time of relentlessly dire headlines — is not to be underestimated. |  | The one real clunk in the works is the framing device. The musical begins at a Brooklyn Community Players performance of “Romeo and Juliet,” whose corpse-strewn ending leaves an English major (Ari Raskin) in tears and her uncultured date (Notardonato) worried that his chance of scoring with her is doomed. So he spins the tale of “Romeo & Bernadette” as the story of “the real Romeo.” His inventiveness might come off as more plausible, and less mansplainy, if we hadn’t seen him barely paying attention to the play. |  | Still, inside the story he weaves, Burshteyn makes Romeo an absolute darling, with an ingenuousness that parents swoon over. It is no spoiler to say that Bernadette eventually recognizes him as a gentler version of a man than her violent fiancé will ever be."

He said it was a source of comfort for residents to know that people far from Uvalde knew of their community’s plight and had sympathy for them. “The eyes of the world were on their home,” he added. |  | The community is still grappling with the immediate aftermath: Gov. Greg Abbott, who was among the officials to visit, said on Tuesday that he had issued a disaster declaration for Uvalde, which mobilizes more state and local resources for the city. |  | And as state law enforcement officials continued their investigation into why police officers had delayed entering a classroom where the gunman was locked in with students, they said on Tuesday that the chief of the school district’s Police Department, Pete Arredondo, had not made himself available for a follow-up interview by investigators. |  | Still, a week after the shooting, the outside attention has started to diminish. The memorials have become less crowded. On the streets, there are fewer reporters, cameras and vehicles emblazoned with the logos of news outlets. |  | Some are already contemplating the arduous road ahead, unsure of what kind of support Uvalde will ultimately need and for how long, particularly the children who are now growing up in the shadow of devastation. |  | Students are just now beginning their summer break from school, but parents are already contemplating how to help their children navigate their grief over the summer months and feel safe and ready to return to school, come fall."

nytimes,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/05/31/opinion/cartoon-classics.html,2022-05-31T00:00:00,"By now you’ve probably guessed that I rank Warner Bros. cartoons as the all-time best. But lately, I’ve thought that they might have some competition: The shorts Disney has been making since 2013. My girls and I call them “Funny Mickeys,” in contrast to Disney’s old shorts, which are expertly animated but, especially by contemporary standards, not narratively engaging. An isolated drawing from “Mr. Duck Steps Out,” for example, hangs on my wall at home and is a nice image of Donald Duck adjusting his hat in preparation for a date. But the cartoon itself, from 1940, just sits there — the liveliest thing is that Donald and Daisy Duck do some dancing. In the newer Disney cartoons, the characters are as laugh-out-loud funny as the Looney Tunes characters have been all along. |  | The artwork is great, too: The updated Disney characters are drawn in a style saluting the original late-1920s, early-1930s versions of the characters, while the backgrounds are gorgeous paintings reminiscent of the ones in Disney classics like “Sleeping Beauty.” But now, the Disney characters have a chance to engage in the same lively wordplay as the Looney Tunes characters, with nearly as much wit. Chris Diamantopoulos is especially good voicing Mickey, wangling the mouse’s classic falsetto into colors and shades that somehow convey a whole soul rather than just a squeaking, two-dimensional protagonist. |  | The Funny Mickeys come with a modern ethos, eschewing the old-school stereotypes found in earlier cartoons. When one of these new shorts is set in a different country, instead of wallowing in silly false-translation jokes, as the old Looney Tunes did (French people fleeing Pepé Le Pew, yelling “Le Pew!”), the characters speak the local language — French, Spanish, Italian, Portuguese, Dutch, Mandarin, Korean, Turkish and Hindi, so far. In “Mumbai Madness,” the series’ composer, Christopher Willis, wrote Bollywood-esque music. |  | Another great thing about these newer shorts is that they revel in the weight of the 20th century’s trove of pop culture references: They mine the Disney heritage itself, from the Disney version of “The Big Bad Wolf” to Ursula from “The Little Mermaid.” In one short, Mickey and Minnie cavort to a 1930’s-style love song, “As Long as I’m With You,” camping it up rather than just doing it straight. Another takes on the quaint ambition of a “Jetsons”-like vision of the future. |  | Willis, whose work is brilliant, seems to have a fondness, where thematically appropriate, for the teasing soft-rock feel of 1970s and 1980s shows such as “The Love Boat” (try, for example, the nautical scenes from “Captain Donald”). Between this, the facial expressions that often seem to channel the weird, densely detailed close-ups of cartoons from the Fleischer studio that created Betty Boop and Popeye, and the whiz-bang pacing familiar from “Ren & Stimpy,” these shorts exist in a kind of otherworldly combination of now and before, the way a good cartoon should. |  | I’ve been forced to rethink my own sense of what belongs on “Best Of” lists: I remain a Looney Tunes loyalist, but the new Disney shorts strike me, often, as some of the best cartoons I’ve ever encountered. They helped me through the pandemic lockdown, are great for taking a load off the mind now, and should be known better than they seem to be."

She is not leaving because she cannot find medicine for her 48-year-old son, who has schizophrenia. |  | BAKHMUT, Ukraine — The volunteers listened patiently to the pensioner and stuffed a frozen chicken into her shopping bag. |  | Olena Tyvaniuk, 70, a slight woman with a stoop, explained tearfully that she needed more than food. She needed drugs. “I have a son, he is 48, he is a paranoid schizophrenic,” she said. “I need medication for him.” |  | As the towns and cities of eastern Ukraine empty out in the face of the Russian offensive, some residents are choosing to stay on. Like Ms. Tyvaniuk, some are trapped by medical imperatives. Or they are too poor to leave. Or, disillusioned by the longstanding corruption of Ukrainian officials, they think things can’t be worse under the Russians. |  | Bakhmut, just 10 miles from the front, is largely deserted. There are few cars on the streets except for military vehicles; shops and banks are boarded up. Only one or two cafes and supermarkets are still open. |  | The only pharmacy is at the hospital where wounded soldiers are brought in from the front. Recently, bloodstained stretchers were propped up against a wall where a wounded soldier, his face bloody and swollen, swathed in bandages, smoked a cigarette with friends. |  | Yet in the middle of war, even as artillery booms not far away, civilians still walk by in the street, sometimes even with a child in tow. |  | Image Bloodied military stretchers outside a hospital in Bakhmut, in the Donbas region.

His medication was running out and the only pharmacy open in the town did not stock the medicine he needed, she said. He had enough left for only four days and was down to cutting slices from his remaining tablets. |  | “He does not understand the whole situation,” she said. “He does not even know his own address. I cannot leave him, and I never will leave him.” |  | Ukrainian officials have repeatedly called on civilians to leave eastern Ukraine as Russia has turned the full strength of its forces on seizing the region. But a portion of the population stubbornly refuses to go. |  | “Those who wanted to go have already gone,” said Ruslan, 42, a volunteer with the Union of Ukrainian Churches who drives people to shelters in western Ukraine. He said his group had evacuated 1,000 people from the Bakhmut area over the past month. |  | Yet of 20 people who had requested evacuation with his organization on Saturday, only nine took up the offer, he said. He had just risked the drive to the frontline town of Siversk to collect people, but came back empty. “No one wants to go,” he said. |  | Image A volunteer from a church group organizing the evacuation of civilians from frontline towns trying to find medicine for Ms. Tyvaniuk.

Finbarr O’Reilly for The New York Times |  | He asked that only his first name be published for fear of retribution from the Russian side. |  | Most of those remaining are the poor, the old and the infirm, volunteers and health workers said. |  | “We mostly see the elderly people seeking all kinds of support,” said Islam Alaraj, program manager for psychosocial support in Ukraine for the International Committee of the Red Cross. “They are the most vulnerable and they have plenty of health issues, and they have added psychological issues above that.” |  | For the most part, Ukrainian health facilities around the country, including psychiatric facilities, are still functional and receiving outside support, Ms. Alaraj said. But as fighting shifts, reaching those in need is becoming more difficult. |  | “This context is changing in a very fast way,” she said, “and we don’t know all locations and we don’t have access to all locations.” |  | Many residents interviewed said they could not afford to rent an apartment elsewhere, and feared losing everything they owned if they abandoned their homes. They also voiced distrust of promises of assistance from aid groups or the government. |  | Image A Ukrainian soldier walking past cars that were blown up at a complex in Bakhmut when it was bombed by Russian forces.

And for them it does not matter who passes them a package of aid, Russia or Ukraine.” |  | Police officers serving until last week in the town of Sievierodonetsk said they saw the mood shifting as Russian forces were poised on the edge of the city. They abandoned a last evacuation when residents asked for extra guarantees. |  | “We don’t force anyone,” Chief Oleh Hryhorov of the regional police said. “Some sympathize with the other side.” |  | Russian troops were flying drones over the town to gather information on Ukrainian positions and some residents were acting as informers for Russia, he said.

Many said they could barely survive on their pension, which amounts to as little as $70 a month. |  | Lyudmila Krilyshkina, 71, displaced after her home burned down in a rocket attack, wept as she complained that she was not able to draw her pension in Bakhmut. Since the shops were taking only cash, she could not buy food for herself and her parents, she said. |  | “They need to think of the people,” she said. “We understand there is a war but how are we supposed to survive?” |  | Another woman waiting to be evacuated complained that only voluntary organizations were helping the people, and that government officials were doing nothing.

Almost as many Americans 65 and older died in four months of the Omicron surge as did in six months of the Delta wave, even though the Delta variant, for any one person, tended to cause more severe illness. |  | While overall per capita Covid death rates have fallen, older people still account for an overwhelming share of them. |  | “This is not simply a pandemic of the unvaccinated,” said Andrew Stokes, an assistant professor in global health at Boston University who studies age patterns of Covid deaths. “There’s still exceptionally high risk among older adults, even those with primary vaccine series.” |  | Covid deaths, though always concentrated in older people, have in 2022 skewed toward older people more than they did at any point since vaccines became widely available. |  | That swing in the pandemic has intensified pressure on the Biden administration to protect older Americans, with health officials in recent weeks encouraging everyone 50 and older to get a second booster and introducing new models of distributing antiviral pills. |  | In much of the country, though, the booster campaign remains listless and disorganized, older people and their doctors said. Patients, many of whom struggle to drive or get online, have to maneuver through an often labyrinthine health care system to receive potentially lifesaving antivirals. |  | Nationwide Covid deaths in recent weeks have been near the lowest levels of the pandemic, below an average of 400 a day. But the mortality gap between older and younger people has grown: Middle-aged Americans, who suffered a large share of pandemic deaths last summer and fall, are now benefiting from new stores of immune protection in the population as Covid deaths once again cluster around older people. |  | And the new wave of Omicron subvariants may create additional threats: While hospitalizations in younger age groups have remained relatively low, admission rates among people 70 and older in the Northeast have climbed to one-third of the winter Omicron wave’s towering peak. |  | “I think we are going to see the death rates rising,” said Dr. Sharon Inouye, a geriatrician and a professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School. “It is going to become more and more risky for older adults as their immunity wanes.” |  | Covid-19 Death Rates for People Age 65+ Unvaccinated 156 deaths per 100,000 100 deaths per 100,000 50 Vaccinated 24 per 100,000 With Booster 7 per 100,000 0 Oct. 2021 Jan. 2022 April 2022 Vaccination Rates for People Age 65+ 100% of people Unvaccinated 80 Vaccinated 60 40 With Booster 20 Oct. 2021 Jan. 2022 April 2022 Covid-19 Death Rates for People Age 65+ Unvaccinated 156 deaths per 100,000 100 deaths per 100,000 50 Vaccinated 24 per 100,000 With Booster 7 per 100,000 0 Oct. 2021 Jan. 2022 April 2022 Vaccination Rates for People Age 65+ 100% of people Unvaccinated 80 Vaccinated 60 40 With Booster 20 Oct. 2021 Jan. 2022 April 2022 |  | Harold Thomas Jr., 70, of Knoxville, Tenn., is one of many older Americans whose immunity may be waning because he has not received a booster shot. The Covid States Project, an academic group, recently estimated that among people 65 and older, 13 percent are unvaccinated, 3 percent have a single Moderna or Pfizer shot and another 14 percent are vaccinated but not boosted. |  | When vaccines first arrived, Mr. Thomas said, the state health department made getting them “convenient” by administering shots at his apartment community for older people. But he did not know of any such effort for booster doses. On the contrary, he remembered a state official publicly casting doubt on boosters as they became available. |  | “The government wasn’t sure about the booster shot,” he said. “If they weren’t sure about it, and they’re the ones who put it out, why would I take it?” Mr. Thomas said Covid recently killed a former boss of his and hospitalized an older family friend. |  | Deaths have fallen from the heights of the winter wave in part because of growing levels of immunity from past infections, experts said. For older people, there is also a grimmer reason: So many of the most fragile Americans were killed by Covid over the winter that the virus now has fewer targets in that age group. |  | But scientists warned that many older Americans remained susceptible. To protect them, geriatricians called on nursing homes to organize in-home vaccinations or mandate additional shots. |  | In the longer term, scientists said that policymakers needed to address the economic and medical ills that have affected especially nonwhite older Americans, lest Covid continue cutting so many of their lives short. |  | “I don’t think we should treat the premature death of older adults as a means of ending the pandemic,” Dr. Stokes said. “There are still plenty of susceptible older adults — living with comorbid conditions or living in multigenerational households — who are highly vulnerable.” |  | The pattern of Covid deaths this year has recreated the dynamics from 2020 — before vaccines were introduced, when the virus killed older Americans at markedly higher rates. Early in the pandemic, mortality rates steadily climbed with each extra year of age, Dr. Stokes and his collaborators found in a recent study. |  | That changed last summer and fall, during the Delta surge. Older people were getting vaccinated more quickly than other groups: By November, the vaccination rate in Americans 65 and older was roughly 20 percentage points higher than that of those in their 40s. And critically, those older Americans had received vaccines relatively recently, leaving them with strong levels of residual protection. |  | As a result, older people suffered from Covid at lower rates than they had been before vaccines became available. Among people 85 and older, the death rate last fall was roughly 75 percent lower than it had been in the winter of 2020, Dr. Stokes’s recent study found. |  | At the same time, the virus walloped younger and less vaccinated Americans, many of whom were also returning to in-person work. Death rates for white people in their late 30s more than tripled last fall compared to the previous winter. Death rates for Black people in the same age group more than doubled. |  | The rebalancing of Covid deaths was so pronounced that, among Americans 80 and older, overall deaths returned to prepandemic levels in 2021, according to a study posted online in February. The opposite was true for middle-aged Americans: Life expectancy in that group, which had already dropped more than it had among the same age range in Europe, fell even further in 2021. |  | “In 2021, you see the mortality impact of the pandemic shift younger,” said Ridhi Kashyap, a lead author of that study and a demographer at the University of Oxford. |  | By the time the highly contagious Omicron variant took over, researchers said, more older Americans had gone a long time since their last Covid vaccination, weakening their immune defenses. |  | As of mid-May, more than one-quarter of Americans 65 and older had not had their most recent vaccine dose within a year. And more than half of people in that age group had not been given a shot in the last six months. |  | The Omicron variant was better than previous versions of the virus at evading those already weakening immune defenses, reducing the effectiveness of vaccines against infection and more serious illness. That was especially true for older people, whose immune systems respond less aggressively to vaccines in the first place. |  | Vaccine Effectiveness Against Hospitalization Two doses Three doses During Delta Wave During Omicron Wave 100% vaccine effectiveness against hospitalization 100% vaccine effectiveness against hospitalization 80 80 60 60 40 40 20 20 0 0 Less than 2 months since last dose 2–3 4 5+ Less than 2 months since last dose 2–3 4 5+ During Delta Wave 100% vaccine effectiveness against hospitalization 80 60 40 20 0 Less than 2 months since last dose 2–3 4 5+ During Omicron Wave 100% vaccine effectiveness against hospitalization 80 60 40 20 0 Less than 2 months since last dose 2–3 4 5+ |  | For some people, even three vaccine doses appear to become less protective over time against Omicron-related hospital admissions. A study published recently in The Lancet Respiratory Medicine found that trend held for people with weakened immune systems, a category that older Americans were likelier to fall into. Sara Tartof, the study’s lead author and an epidemiologist at Kaiser Permanente in Southern California, said that roughly 9 percent of people 65 and older in the study were immunocompromised, compared with 2.5 percent of adults under 50. |  | During the Omicron wave, Covid death rates were once again dramatically higher for older Americans than younger ones, Dr. Stokes said. Older people also made up an overwhelming share of the excess deaths — the difference between the number of people who actually died and the number who would have been expected to die if the pandemic had never happened. |  | Dr. Jeremy Faust, an emergency physician at Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston, found in a recent study that excess deaths were more heavily concentrated in people 65 and older during the Omicron wave than the Delta surge. Overall, the study found, there were more excess deaths in Massachusetts during the first eight weeks of Omicron than during the 23-week period when Delta dominated. |  | As older people began dying at higher rates, Covid deaths also came to include higher proportions of vaccinated people. In March, about 40 percent of the people who died from Covid were vaccinated, according to an analysis of figures from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. |  | Fewer older Americans have also been infected during the pandemic than younger people, leading to lower levels of natural immunity. As of February, roughly one-third of people 65 and older showed evidence of prior infections, compared with about two-thirds of adults under 50. |  | Estimated Share of People in the U.S. With Antibodies From Covid-19 Infection 0% 40 60 80 100 20 0–11 years old 12–17 18–49 50–64 65+ 0% 40 60 80 100 20 0–11 years old 12–17 18–49 50–64 65+ |  | Long-ago Covid cases do not prevent future infections, but reinfected people are less likely to become seriously ill. |  | A drop-off in Covid precautions this winter, combined with the high transmissibility of Omicron, left older people more exposed, scientists said. It is unclear how their own behavior may have changed. An earlier study, from scientists at Marquette University, suggested that while older people in Wisconsin had once been wearing masks at rates higher than those of younger people, that gap had effectively disappeared by mid-2021. |  | Antiviral pills are now being administered in greater numbers, but it is difficult to know who is benefiting from them. Scientists said that the wintertime spike in Covid death rates among older Americans demanded a more urgent policy response. |  | Dr. Inouye, of Harvard Medical School, said she had waited for a notice from her mother’s assisted living facility about the rollout of second booster shots even as reports started arriving of staff members becoming infected. But still, the facility’s director said that a second booster shot drive was impossible without state guidance. |  | Eventually, her family had to arrange a trip to a pharmacy on their own for a second booster. |  | “It just seems that now the onus is put completely on the individual,” she said. “It’s not like it’s made easy for you.”"

Powell, the Federal Reserve chair, at the White House on Tuesday, as part of an effort to both sell Americans on a brightening view of the economy and reassure consumers that leaders in Washington are hard at work to slow rapidly rising prices. |  | White House officials cast the visit as a chance for Mr. Biden, who nominated Mr. Powell for a second term as Fed chair late last year, to congratulate him on his recent Senate confirmation. It was also the start of a monthlong attempt to convince the public that inflation is coming under control and that the economy is performing far better than Mr. Biden’s polling numbers would suggest. |  | Speaking to reporters at the start of the meeting, which also included Treasury Secretary Janet L. Yellen, a former Fed chair, Mr. Biden reiterated that fighting inflation was his top economic priority and that he would not interfere with the Fed as it tried to tame rising prices. |  | That fight, Mr. Biden said, “starts with a simple proposition: Respect the Fed, respect the Fed’s independence, which I have done and will continue to do.” |  | The president added that Mr. Powell “and other members of the Fed have noted at this moment they have been laser focused on addressing inflation like I am.” |  | The Fed has begun raising interest rates to slow down the economy, hoping that reining in consumer demand will eventually help bring price increases under control. |  | But while the central bank may help cool down the economy to a more sustainable path over time, the Fed’s moves are likely to hurt in the near term: Rate increases are making it more expensive for households and businesses to borrow money to fund big purchases, and they work to counteract inflation partly by slowing down hiring and wage growth. |  | Mr. Biden’s push to slow inflation, with the Fed leading the charge, puts Mr. Powell in a potentially awkward position. The president has repeatedly said that he respects the Fed’s independence to set monetary policy and that he will not cajole the central bank to change interest rates, as his predecessor, former President Donald J. Trump, loved to do. But Mr. Biden has also made clear that he expects the Fed to tame inflation without plunging the economy into a recession, a combination that could be difficult for Mr. Powell to pull off. |  | Inflation in the United States is running near its fastest pace in four decades, with prices rising for gas, food and rent. While price pressures have shown early signs of abating, it is unclear how large and sustainable that decline will be, given kinks in global supply chains and Russia’s war in Ukraine. |  | Americans have become pessimistic about the economy and their own financial prospects as their paychecks have failed to keep up with inflation. The squeeze hitting consumers comes at a tough time for the White House and Democrats, as the November midterm elections approach and voters cite inflation and the cost of living as top economic concerns. |  | Mr. Biden has consistently struck a far more optimistic tone than the broader public on the economy, stressing month after month of rapid job growth — and an ensuing drop in the unemployment rate — as the country recovers from the pandemic recession. |  | After more than a year of watching inflation rise faster than his economic advisers projected, the president in recent weeks has attempted to convey more urgency with his comments on inflation, promising to do everything in his power to slow rising costs. |  | Top economic officials in the administration fanned out across cable news programs and the White House briefing room on Tuesday to hammer the message that job growth has rebounded strongly and that the economy is transitioning to a more stable growth rate — and to lower inflation. |  | Mr. Biden “understands that right now the top issue on people’s minds is prices — prices at the gas station, prices at the grocery store,” Brian Deese, who heads the White House National Economic Council, told reporters on Tuesday. “And he’s made very clear, and he’s communicating very clearly, that that’s his top economic priority and that we can address this from a position of strength.” |  | Mr. Biden stressed those points in a Wall Street Journal opinion piece published online Monday evening, in which he stressed wealth gains for typical Americans on his watch and said the United States was “in a better economic position than almost any other country.” He promised to fight inflation by reducing the federal budget deficit, working to repair broken global supply chains, passing legislation to reduce energy costs for families and relying on the Fed. |  | “With the right policies,” he wrote, “the U.S. can transition from recovery to stable, steady growth and bring down inflation without giving up all these historic gains.” |  | Ms. Yellen acknowledged after the meeting on Tuesday that she had been wrong to downplay inflation, noting that the economy faced unexpected shocks and supply chain problems that boosted food and energy prices. |  | “Well, look, I think I was wrong then about the path that inflation would take,” Ms. Yellen told CNN. |  | While Mr. Biden has announced some measures aimed at reducing costs — and Mr. Deese and other aides have called on Congress to do more to aid in the effort — the president has made clear that he is counting on the Fed to help tame inflation. |  | Rapid price increases are also a problem globally, as beleaguered shipping routes and factory shutdowns in China keep some goods in short supply and as the war in Ukraine pushes up fuel and food costs. The European Central Bank is expected to begin raising interest rates this summer, and the Bank of England, Reserve Bank of Australia and Bank of Canada are among a group of other monetary policy authorities that have already begun raising their borrowing costs. |  | With central banks around the world pulling back economic support, the war in Ukraine stoking uncertainty and China locking down cities to try to keep the coronavirus from spreading, risks to the global economy are significant. |  | At the Fed’s meeting this month, “various” policymaking officials “noted downside risks to the outlook, including risks associated with the Russian invasion and Covid-related lockdowns in China and the likelihood of a prolonged rise in energy and commodity prices,” minutes of the gathering, which were released last week, showed."
nytimes,https://www.nytimes.com/live/2022/05/31/us/midterms-primary-elections,2022-05-31T00:00:00,"Cleta Mitchell, a Republican lawyer and architect of Donald J. Trump’s failed efforts to overturn the 2020 presidential election, at the Pennsylvania Leadership Conference in April. |  | In a hotel conference center outside Harrisburg, Pa., Cleta Mitchell, one of the key figures in a failed scheme to overturn Donald J. Trump’s defeat, was leading a seminar on “election integrity.” |  | “We are taking the lessons we learned in 2020 and we are going forward to make sure they never happen again,” Ms. Mitchell told the crowd of about 150 activists-in-training. |  | She would be “putting you to work,” she told them. |  | In the days after the 2020 election, Ms. Mitchell was among a cadre of Republican lawyers who frantically compiled unsubstantiated accusations, debunked claims and an array of confusing and inconclusive eyewitness reports to build the case that the election was marred by fraud. Courts rejected the cases and election officials were unconvinced, thwarting a stunning assault on the transfer of power. |  | Now Ms. Mitchell is prepping for the next election. Working with a well-funded network of organizations on the right, including the Republican National Committee, she is recruiting election conspiracists into an organized cavalry of activists monitoring elections. |  | In seminars around the country, Ms. Mitchell is marshaling volunteers to stake out election offices, file information requests, monitor voting, work at polling places and keep detailed records of their work. She has tapped into a network of grass-root groups that promote misinformation and espouse wild theories about the 2020 election, including the fiction that President Biden’s victory could still be decertified and Mr. Trump reinstated. |  | One concern is the group’s intent to research the backgrounds of local and state officials to determine whether each is a “friend or foe” of the movement. Many officials already feel under attack by those who falsely contend that the 2020 election was stolen. |  | An extensive review of Ms. Mitchell’s effort, including documents and social media posts, interviews and attendance at the Harrisburg seminar, reveals a loose network of influential groups and fringe figures. They include election deniers as well as mainstream organizations such as the Heritage Foundation’s political affiliate, Tea Party Patriots and the R.N.C., which has participated in Ms. Mitchell’s seminars. The effort, called the Election Integrity Network, is a project of the Conservative Partnership Institute, a right-wing think tank with close ties and financial backing from Mr. Trump’s political operation. |  | Ms. Mitchell says she is creating “a volunteer army of citizens” who can counter what she describes as Democratic bias in election offices. |  | “We’re going to be watching. We’re going to take back our elections,” she said in an April interview with John Fredericks, a conservative radio host. “The only way they win is to cheat,” she added. |  | The claim that Mr. Trump lost the election because of improper conduct in election offices or rampant voter fraud is false. Mr. Trump’s defeat was undisputed among election officials and certified by Democrats and Republicans, with many recounts and audits verifying the outcome. Mr. Trump’s Justice Department found no evidence of widespread fraud. Mr. Trump lost more than 50 of his postelection challenges in court. |  | Campaigns, parties and outside groups from both sides of the political spectrum regularly form poll-monitoring operations and recruit poll workers. And Republicans have in the past boasted of plans to build an “army” of observers, raising fears about widespread voter intimidation and conflict at the polls that largely have not materialized. |  | Some former election officials say they are hopeful that when election skeptics observe the process they may finally be convinced that the system is sound. But several who examined Ms. Mitchell’s training materials and statements at the request of The New York Times sounded alarms about her tactics. |  | Ms. Mitchell’s trainings promote particularly aggressive methods — with a focus on surveillance — that appear intended to feed on activists’ distrust and create pressure on local officials, rather than ensure voters’ access to the ballot, they say. A test drive of the strategy in the Virginia governor’s race last year highlighted how quickly the work — when conducted by people convinced of falsehoods about fraud — can disrupt the process and spiral into bogus claims, even in a race Republicans won. |  | “I think it’s going to come down to whether they are truly interested in knowing the truth about elections or they’re interested in propagating propaganda,” said Al Schmidt, a Republican and former city commissioner of Philadelphia who served on the elections board. |  | Asked about her project at the Pennsylvania training, Ms. Mitchell declined an interview request and asked a reporter to leave. |  | In a statement emailed later, she said: “The American election system envisions citizen engagement and we are training people to assume the roles outlined in the statutes.” |  | Ms. Mitchell’s operation sits at a tension point for her party. While the establishment is eager to take advantage of the base’s energy and outrage over 2020, some are wary of being associated with — or held accountable for — some of the more extreme people in the movement. The feeling is mutual among activists, many of whom believe the R.N.C. did not do enough to back Mr. Trump’s challenge. |  | The Republican National Committee’s involvement is part of a return to widespread election-work organizing. For nearly 30 years, the committee was limited in some operations by a consent decree after Democrats accused party officials in New Jersey of hiring off-duty police officers and posting signs intended to scare Black and Latino people away from voting. The committee was freed of restrictions in 2018. |  | This year, its multimillion-dollar investment includes hiring 18 state “election integrity” directors and 19 state “election integrity” lawyers. The party has so far recruited more than 5,000 poll watchers and nearly 12,000 poll workers, according to the committee. These efforts are separate from the Election Integrity Network, said Emma Vaughn, an R.N.C. spokeswoman. |  | But in multiple states, the R.N.C. election integrity directors have been involved in Ms. Mitchell’s events. Ms. Vaughn acknowledged that party officials participate in events hosted by other groups to recruit poll workers and poll watchers. She noted that in many states poll monitors must be authorized by the party. The R.N.C. is training its monitors to comply with laws protecting voting rights, she said. |  | “The R.N.C. works with other groups who have an interest in promoting election integrity, but the party’s efforts are independent from any outside organization,” Ms. Vaughn said. |  | Harnessing the Energy |  | Since 2020, scores of local groups have popped up around the country to promote claims about the election. Many are run by activists with little experience in politics or elections but who have amassed sizable membership lists and social media followers. They are spurred on by national figures touring the circuit and spreading false claims. |  | Ms. Mitchell stepped in to harness that energy. |  | The 71-year-old lawyer has been a steady and influential force in the voting battles. Once a liberal Democrat in Oklahoma, Ms. Mitchell has been a fixture in the conservative movement. She has represented the National Rifle Association and was on the board of the American Conservative Union. She has worked closely with Virginia Thomas, the wife of the Supreme Court justice Clarence Thomas, on organizing through the Council for National Policy, a national coordinating group for conservative leaders. |  | In August 2020, Mr. Trump tapped her to prepare for postelection litigation. She enlisted John Eastman, the lawyer who crafted specious legal theories claiming Vice President Mike Pence could keep Mr. Trump in power. “A movement is stirring,” Ms. Mitchell wrote to Mr. Eastman just two days after Election Day. “But needs constitutional support.” |  | Ms. Mitchell helped the president argue his case to state officials. She was on the phone with Mr. Trump when he asked Brad Raffensperger, Georgia’s secretary of state, to “find 11,780 votes” that could reverse Mr. Trump’s defeat there. |  | Her latest effort is organized through the Conservative Partnership Institute, a nonprofit organization where she serves as a senior legal fellow and where Mark Meadows, Mr. Trump’s final White House chief of staff, is a senior partner. Mr. Trump’s political action committee, Save America PAC, donated $1 million to the group last year. |  | Ms. Mitchell has described herself as a key conduit between activists and Republican Party leadership. |  | “We are trying to bridge the gap between the grass-roots and some of the issues we’ve had with the party,” she told trainees at the event outside Harrisburg. |  | Ms. Mitchell is no doubt connecting with some of the fringe groups and ideas some in the party once avoided. |  | In Virginia, for example, Ms. Mitchell helped a nonprofit organize a coalition that includes Virginians for America First, a group advocating for hand-counting ballots. It’s a position popular among some of those who believe conspiracy theories about foreign hacking in the 2020 election. The group was funded by Patrick Byrne, the former Overstock.com executive who is now a major benefactor of the election denial movement. |  | Image Mark Finchem, a state representative from Arizona, at a MAGA rally at the Michigan State Capitol in Lansing, Mich., in March. Credit... Nic Antaya for The New York Times |  | In Michigan, Ms. Mitchell’s group held a training session in May that was sponsored in part by a coalition of grass-roots groups called the Michigan Election Protection Team. The R.N.C.’s state election integrity director brought together the coalition to recruit poll workers. According to its website, the coalition includes LaRouchePAC, a committee dedicated to Lyndon LaRouche, the deceased conspiracy theorist, and Let’s Fix Stuff, an outfit run by a former Republican state senator who has promoted a theory about the 2020 election that Republican Michigan Senate leaders denounced as “indefensible.” |  | The R.N.C. sent both its national and state election integrity directors to Ms. Mitchell’s training near Harrisburg. The state director, Andrea Raffle, had worked alongside Ms. Mitchell for months on the event, one of the speakers told the attendees. Ms. Raffle, as well as an organizer from Heritage Action, would be joining a new coalition of election activists led by Toni Shuppe, a fast-rising state activist, organizers announced. |  | Ms. Shuppe’s group, Audit the Vote PA, has become a leading peddler of misleading data about the election in Pennsylvania. Last year, the group set out to find evidence of fraud by canvassing neighborhoods in search of discrepancies between election results and information collected from residents, a method that election experts dismiss as invalid. |  | Ms. Shuppe has admitted to flaws in her data but stands by the conclusions of her analysis. Earlier this year, she circulated a petition that declared citizens’ right “to throw off such government that intends to keep the truth behind the 2020 election hidden.” |  | Now, Ms. Shuppe is recruiting election activists, using what she learned at Ms. Mitchell’s and other training sessions, she said in an interview. So far, around 200 people have signed up, she said. |  | “Just know that we have a plan,” she wrote the day after the Harrisburg seminar to her 15,000 Telegram subscribers. “We’ll never quit. This must be fixed. There is no going back to sleep. And 2020 still needs decertified.” |  | Image Election workers in Philadelphia sorting through ballots the day after Election Day in 2020. Credit... Kriston Jae Bethel for The New York Times |  | ‘Is That a Friend or Foe?’ |  | Much of Ms. Shuppe’s plan is laid out in “The Citizens Guide to Building an Election Integrity Infrastructure,” a 19-page manual Ms. Mitchell has distributed at trainings and online. |  | The document includes some typical guidelines for poll monitors, but elections experts also noted tactics that aren’t routine. The manual advises activists to “be ever-present” inside elections offices, and to meet with post office officials to observe “every step” of the vote-by-mail process allowed by law. They’re advised to keep careful records, including details on any “encounter that is intended to make you uncomfortable being at the election offices.” |  | They recommend aggressively crowdsourcing the accuracy of the voter rolls by collecting affidavits from residents and mailing letters to try to identify potential “bad addresses.” They advise each group to enlist tech-savvy volunteers who, they suggest, can become expert on the specific software and equipment in each county and “what the vulnerabilities are.” |  | Activists also were advised to research the backgrounds of election officials, key staff members, and even people inside attorney general offices who work on election issues. The question they should pose about the attorney general officials is, “Is that a friend or foe?” it says. |  | Coaching poll monitors to consider election officials as enemies is a formula for conflict, said Tammy Patrick, a former federal compliance officer for the Maricopa County elections department in Arizona, who reviewed the manual. |  | “Sixty to 70 percent of the content is educational, it is observation, it’s transparency,” said Ms. Patrick, who now is a senior adviser to the elections program at Democracy Fund. “But throughout the document, there’s this pitting of people against the election official or the people they’re there to learn from.” |  | “If they’re being obstructionary and slowing down the process, that’s going to be incredibly challenging,” she said. |  | Ms. Mitchell said election officials “should have no problem with citizens asking questions and helping them do their jobs better.” She noted the activists are instructed to be courteous and respectful. |  | Indeed, at the Harrisburg training, Jenny Beth Martin, the leader of Tea Party Patriots, a conservative advocacy group, suggested activists use a three-word response whenever they become frustrated with officials: “Bless your heart,” she said. |  | A Test Run in Virginia |  | Ms. Mitchell has repeatedly held up Virginia, and particularly Fairfax County, as the national model. Ahead of last year’s governor’s race between Glenn Youngkin, a Republican businessman, and Terry McAuliffe, a Democratic former governor, she helped a Virginia nonprofit organize dozens of groups into a coalition. The network ultimately trained 4,500 poll watchers and election workers and organized 18 local task forces, a number that has since doubled, organizers say. |  | In Fairfax, a Democratic bastion outside Washington, about three dozen activists associated with the coalition and the local Republican Party rotated through election offices, combing through voter registration applications, undeliverable mail and other materials. Christine Brim, the task force’s leader, appeared in person or emailed staff nearly every day, according to Scott Konopasek, the registrar at the time. The operation ate up county workers’ time with dozens of information requests, as well as informal interrogations, Mr. Konopasek said. |  | “Everything they saw that they didn’t understand was fraud in their minds and that’s how they would frame the questions,” he said. “It was always accusatory.” |  | Steve Knotts, the Fairfax County G.O.P. chairman, said the activists were merely trying to get answers, particularly because the state had initiated new voting procedures. But election officials would often dodge their questions or brush them off, he said. |  | “Maybe it offended a few people. It wasn’t intended to be that way,” he said. |  | Two weeks before the election, the nonprofit behind the Virginia coalition filed a lawsuit, accusing the county of violating state voting law by accepting at least 339 ballot applications that were missing Social Security numbers. A judge ruled that the group did not have standing, which did not settle the legal question — or the dispute. |  | The G.O.P. activists continued to press Mr. Konopasek and other election workers about it, he and others said. The Gateway Pundit, a right-wing website, reported on the complaint saying “the state of Virginia is being stolen again. We saw it in the 2020 election and we are seeing it again.” |  | Image Early voting in Virginia in 2021. There were complaints of aggressive Republican election monitoring at polling sites. Credit... Kenny Holston for The New York Times |  | Virginians for America First, the coalition member that promotes hand-counting ballots, began posting reports online purporting to show potential problems with absentee ballots and other issues. “It is also clear that the level of potential fraud is significant enough to affect the outcome of these elections,” said one memo, dated five days before the election. |  | On Election Day, Republican poll watchers in 13 polling places were observed being disruptive, hovering too closely or taking photographs, according to reports that elections workers filed to the county. (Election workers at three sites had similar complaints about Democratic poll monitors. Complaints from 10 sites did not specify the poll watchers’ parties.) |  | In at least one case, according to the reports, a voter who spoke Spanish left without voting after what two poll workers believed was intimidation from a Republican poll watcher. |  | Poll workers in other locations noted Republican poll watchers acting like, as one put it, “sleuths.” “They should not be able to act like Detective Chief Inspector Barnaby ferreting out clues,” that poll worker wrote. |  | Andrianne Konstas, a poll worker and volunteer with the League of Women Voters, said, “It almost felt like if Youngkin hadn’t won, it would be like we’re gathering evidence so we can take it to dismiss precincts or to dismiss a process of voting.” |  | ‘We Needed a Fighter’ |  | After the election, the party activists continued to press for change. They put a new Republican on the election board, someone Ms. Brim, the group’s leader, describes as “a real activist.” |  | “We needed a fighter,” she said, as she recounted her work for the activists at the Harrisburg training. |  | The new board member, Christopher Henzel, told The Times he would promote transparency to ensure “that elections are both fair and perceived as fair.” |  | Despite some concerns about these groups’ involvement, the 2021 election overall ran smoothly. It might have helped to have the most skeptical people closely engaged, said Christopher Piper, who until recently ran the Virginia Department of Elections. |  | “Yes, it was a little bit more annoying, but I think at the end of the day it’s worth it so these people can see the process and feel comfortable and know that it’s a safe, secure process,” Mr. Piper said. |  | But Mr. Konopasek, the former registrar in Fairfax County, resigned in March in large part because of how difficult Ms. Brim and others were making his job, he said. In his 30-year career, he said, he had never seen anything like it. |  | “If there’s an absence of good will there’s nothing you can say that’s going to reassure someone or win them over or change their mind,” he said. |  | Nick Corasaniti contributed reporting."

Entonces, ¿por qué habríamos de aplicar una discriminación prenatal? Lo que presuponemos es que se han de tener en cuenta las desventajas que representan para un niño vivo la pobreza, la violencia o una salud frágil, por medio de una generosidad y unos cuidados adicionales. Algunos países, como Polonia y Malta, imponen severas restricciones al aborto, pero también tienen Estados del bienestar generosos que brindan un sólido apoyo a las familias. |  | Solo hay una circunstancia en la que creo que es permisible —incluso lo correcto— matar a un bebé en el útero: cuando la existencia de ese bebé está matando a la madre y extraérselo es la única manera de salvarle la vida. Ante la probabilidad de que la Corte Suprema de Estados Unidos revoque el caso Roe contra Wade, hay unos 26 estados preparados para promulgar nuevas restricciones al aborto. Cualquier ley que restrinja el aborto debería permitir siempre aquellos abortos necesarios para salvar la vida de la madre. |  | La urgencia moral del aborto, en el caso de mi paciente, era muy clara. Ya había perdido casi la mitad de volumen sanguíneo cuando llegó a nuestra puerta. Sin una intervención inmediata, habría seguido desangrándose hasta que ella y su bebé hubiesen muerto.

It seemed that many Afghan fighters, used to unlaced shoes, were “losing tens of thousands of man-hours a day,” struggling with the extensive laces on their combat boots. |  | The factory owner had invented military sandals “that adhered to their cultural norms,” Mr. Griffin said. When the owner told him he had no plans for the factory after the war, Mr. Griffin ventured to turn the business into something viable and enduring, benefiting the country where he once fought. |  | He called another Ranger buddy, Donald Lee, and the two pondered how to get Afghan footwear into the American marketplace. They started making flip-flops in the country in 2012 and “immediately failed,” he said. They eventually shifted production to Colombia, benefiting from bilateral trade agreements with the United States, and began selling Combat Flip Flops online in 2013."

The wire holding the elevator broke under the additional weight, and the foreman and worker plummeted down the shaft with it,” said a spokeswoman, Patrice O’Shaughnessy, using Mr. Pineda’s maternal surname. |  | Jonathan Moran, a lawyer representing both Mr. Pineda and the Sánchez estate, said that the laborers were never told not to use the elevator, and that no caution signs or fencing signaled that it remained out of service — an assertion supported by an OSHA inspection performed after the incident. He said that the Bronx District Attorney’s Office had never interviewed Mr. Pineda, and described its inquiry as “superficial, one-sided and woefully inadequate.” |  | Last month, after The Times asked the district attorney’s office and the city’s Department of Investigation why their inquiry into the elevator collapse did not include talking to the sole survivor, they said that the investigation was ongoing. Days later, they interviewed Mr. Pineda. |  | OSHA eventually cited the laborers’ employer, KM Builders, for several violations related to work-site safety in general and the elevator collapse in particular, with penalties totaling $48,370. The company, through its lawyer, declined to comment. It has not paid the penalties. |  | Government agencies also cited Mr. Madruga’s company, GDI Construction, once again for multiple safety violations in connection with the death of a laborer on its construction site, this time with possible penalties of nearly $125,000. |  | And once again, the Buildings Department issued a full-stop work order at 20 Bruckner. Once again, it pressured GDI Construction to provide a safer job site, directing the company to hire both a full-time “safety compliance officer” and a “site safety manager.” The stop-work order was lifted three months later. |  | The spokesman for GDI Construction said the company had met and exceeded the city’s demands, with extra employees on site to ensure that all “safety-related details” were addressed. He added, “Construction inherently presents risks, and though safety measures, precautions and protocols were in place on this job site, these unfortunate accidents occurred.”"

Even if sick leave policies became more generous at the beginning of the pandemic, those days are over for most. Fewer people can work from home now. Even fewer can keep asking to miss work because they have some mild symptoms that may or may not be Covid. |  | The United States is the only wealthy country in the world that does not guarantee paid sick days or sick leave to workers. According to a 2020 report from the Center for Economic and Policy Research, some countries (Canada, France, Italy and Japan) have government insurance systems that provide benefits to workers even when they have short-term illnesses. Other countries, like Greece, Ireland and Spain, mandate employer protections in addition to government insurance. Still more (Denmark, Finland, France, Iceland, Norway and Sweden) have paid leave through collective bargaining arrangements. |  | Some countries are more generous than others. If people get Covid or another illness in Switzerland or Australia, then they are guaranteed to receive a full 10 days of paid sick leave. In the Netherlands, they’re guaranteed seven. In Japan, just under five; in France, three to four; and in Britain, just over one. |  | Only in the United States are we not guaranteed any paid days off. |  | Of course, just because companies aren’t mandated to offer paid leave doesn’t mean that some don’t provide it. The reason I was able to stay home was that my employer is quite generous with its paid time off. Many Americans are not so lucky. |  | While most workers have some sick leave, it’s woefully insufficient. The median number of paid days off each year is seven. One in five workers has fewer than five days a year. Such workers have full-time jobs, though. Many Americans work part time or hourly and have no paid sick leave at all. Even states and cities that have regulations mandating some paid sick leave usually focus on companies of a certain size and workers with a certain number of hours at the job."

This is your captain speaking. |  | kara swisher |  | After 36 years, Tom Cruise is back in a fighter jet. |  | archived recording 2 And we’re off. |  | kara swisher |  | He’s starring in “Top Gun, Maverick.” |  | archived recording 3 3, 2, 1. |  | kara swisher |  | As most people know, I love the original “Top Gun.” And I’m not the only one. My guest, David Ellison, loves it so much that he pushed for a decade to get a sequel made. Unlike me, Ellison had the power to make that happen. He’s the founder and C.E.O. of Skydance Media, which is behind the new release. Ellison had a rocky start in Hollywood. He’s the son of tech mogul, Larry Ellison. And after showing up in Hollywood in the 2000s, he funded some films that, frankly, tanked. But since then, he’s turned things around. Now his company seems to have become a Hollywood success story. So I wanted to ask Ellison how he righted the ship, what he thinks of Silicon Valley’s relationship with Hollywood and get the story behind the new “Top Gun.” David, welcome to “Sway.” |  | david ellison |  | Thank you for having me. It’s a pleasure to be here. |  | kara swisher |  | Thanks. So I just want to say, I went to the premiere in London. You’re trying to get me excited. I’m very excited about “Top Gun.” I think “Top Gun” is one of my favorite movies, and I have a deep love of it in spite of myself. So when did you decide to make a sequel of it? |  | david ellison |  | So, like you, the movie could not mean more to me. It’s one of my favorite of all times. I will never forget seeing the film when I was a little kid because it was the movie that made me want to become a pilot. And I started flying airplanes when I was 13 years old and then started flying air shows when I was 17, 18 — and had the privilege of going up with the Blue Angels and the Thunderbirds. And I can’t tell you how many pilots of my generation watch that movie and said, that’s what they want to do one day. |  | kara swisher |  | You did acrobatics, right? You did aerial acrobatics. |  | david ellison |  | Yeah, I started flying competition aerobatics. Sold it in a German-made Extra 300L when I was 16 years old. I failed my drive test the same day. But yeah, no, I started flying when I was 16 and kind of did air shows until I was 22, and was actually going to film school at the time and kind of decided to kind of hang up the competitive aerobatics basically for school at U.S.C. |  | kara swisher |  | So it took 10 years to develop the sequel. Now, a lot of things go into sequel pretty quickly. Talk about why it took so long. |  | david ellison |  | Yeah, it was 10 years to develop the movie. And first, I have to say, the only reason we were able to make a sequel is because of what Tom, Tony Scott and Jerry Bruckheimer did on that first movie, which, as you said, was iconic and very much helped define a generation in terms of cinema. In terms of the sequel, it was the first movie I wanted to make when we originally signed our deal with Paramount to co-produce and co-finance pictures back in 2010. There was nothing in development, but given how formative the film had been to me in my life, I really wanted to make a sequel to it because I thought there was something incredibly interesting about exploring Maverick at this point in time in his life. And — |  | kara swisher |  | Mm-hmm, who hasn’t changed at all, by the way, but go ahead. Hasn’t changed one bit in, what, 30 years or whatever. |  | david ellison |  | Yeah, I will say Tom is a little singular, in that regard. But you know, the goal that we really had is we wanted to get the original group of filmmakers back together. And so, my journey on “Top Gun” started in a meeting with Tony Scott. |  | kara swisher |  | Tony Scott is the director, who has since died. |  | david ellison |  | Yes, the late great Tony Scott, where I talked to him about a sequel, and he promptly said no several times. And we were actually in a meeting for another project when I brought up “Top Gun” at the end of the meeting, and Tony finally said, OK, pitch me something. If you’re really this serious, please pitch me something. So I went home, did a tremendous amount of research, went over to RSA, knowing that it was, as these things can be, always a long shot. And Tony said yes in the room. |  | kara swisher |  | Mm-hmm, and so what were the challenges of doing that? |  | david ellison |  | The biggest challenge is with and why the movie took 10 years was, for starters, it was all about the script. Tom was very clear that he was not going to make a sequel until he thought the screenplay and the story was worthy of that. You know, that was the film that really helped launch Tom into kind of singular movie star status that he currently sits atop of. And the mantra on the movie was, this isn’t a bullseye movie. This is hitting a bullet with a bullet. And we’re not going to start making this movie until we have it right. And when we started making the movie, it was, we are going to continue to work on it until it got to a place that everybody was happy with. |  | kara swisher |  | Well, because there’s a lot of shitty sequels. When they come back, you sort of cringe. And many of the sequels, they’re not very good in general. |  | david ellison |  | And that is exactly what we did not want to do. |  | kara swisher |  | Now what was interesting, in some of the reviews, people are sort of shocked that it’s good. I was like, the original was good. One of the headlines that I thought was funny, it was, “Against All Odds, ‘Top Gun, Maverick’ is Actually Good.” Why do you think people have that idea of this particular movie? Because it was a good movie when it was out. It was an iconic movie. |  | david ellison |  | Yeah, no, look, I think it’s always — especially it’s, when you make a sequel 36 years later, which doesn’t happen very often, I think it’s sometimes easy to be cynical. And I think expectations are really high. When I think about what this movie meant to me and what it means to so many, I think people are understandably apprehensive about whether or not anything would ever be done to kind of tarnish the legacy of the franchise. We understood that. And it’s why we really set the bar as high as humanly possible. You know, from our standpoint — and I learned this very early on — quality is always the best business plan. You always have to aim as high as humanly possible. And there is nobody who embodies that characteristic more than Tom Cruise. |  | kara swisher |  | So that’s an interesting thing because there’s parallels between the film’s handling of “Maverick” as the last of a dying breed, and Cruise is one of the few — he really is one of the few old school action stars. Can you talk a little bit about that? |  | david ellison |  | He is. One of my favorite scenes in the movie is when Ed Harris looks at Maverick and says, your kind is headed for extinction. And Maverick says, “Maybe so, sir, but not today.” |  | kara swisher |  | Right, yeah, a great line. |  | david ellison |  | And there’s so much I think in this particular moment in time, as people are just starting to come back to the movies and the conversation that’s taking place around the big screen in general, which we could not be more supportive of. And this movie in particular is designed to be seen on the biggest screen possible and really is a love letter to aviation. It’s a love letter to fighter pilot culture. And it’s a celebration of the big screen, the big screen experience. |  | kara swisher |  | So talk about that because one of the things I walked away from is, movies have changed rather dramatically, even the ones — “Star Trek,” you’re making. They’re faster, they’re quicker. This is a very traditional movie, in a way that I haven’t seen in a while. Did you think about that when you were making it, the idea of more traditional when younger people are either attached to superheroes, or they’re not used to the pacing of it? How did you — did you think about that? |  | david ellison |  | We did. We definitely talked about wanting to capture a lot of the spirit of what the ‘80s movies were, but really update it for today in terms of honoring the sequel. And then the other thing that we were just adamant about from day one was, we were going to shoot everything real. Tom was adamant that everybody go up in the F-18. And so we actually put together a training program where it was three months for the entire cast, where they graduated from flying Cessna 172s to Extra 300s, then flying L-39 with the Patriots Jet Team, and then ultimately being ready to step into the F-18. Because when you shoot that type of photography reel, it is an entirely different experience for the audience. |  | kara swisher |  | Right, and when you think about the other movies, do you see doing a lot of movies like that? Because people are used to this highly computerized version of movies, essentially. |  | david ellison |  | I think it always depends on the story. And I think you always have to approach it as what better suits that story. I will say, having had the privilege of making — “Top Gun” is number six. The next two missions will be seven and eight with Tom. There has always been a philosophy to do everything real. Because when it’s in camera, it is a different experience for the audience. If it can be done real and in camera, that is something that we have done across all of the mission movies. |  | kara swisher |  | Right, who was hanging off that thing, right? |  | david ellison |  | The Burj Khalifa, yeah, no, I will never forget that being in Dubai. Skydance was a year old. And it was remarkable. I was sitting there when Tom actually stepped outside onto that building. It was close to the 150th floor. You got a pit in your stomach staring at Video Village that day. And it’s just, when the audience sees that, you know they’re going to experience that. And one of the things that has always amazed me about Tom is the extraordinary lengths that he will go to, to entertain an audience. |  | kara swisher |  | Yeah, he really — that’s one of his big things. He always wants to give their money’s worth. So I want to talk about your Hollywood origin story. People may assume you have an easy ride into Hollywood, given your father is Larry Ellison and gave you money. He told me about it. He told me. And actually, one night, he gave me a lot of details about how much money he gave you and your sister, who is also a filmmaker. But you did some early projects, like “Flyboys” and “Northern Lights,” and they struggled. And you started in acting, and then you moved behind the scenes. Talk about that journey, because what went wrong there in terms of you moving into acting versus really, essentially, being a business person and producer? |  | david ellison |  | Well, being a terrible actor, for starters, would be one of the problems. And — |  | kara swisher |  | OK, there’s a lot of terrible actors, but move along. Go. |  | david ellison |  | No, no, it’s — so my story really started with, you know, I was fortunate, I mean incredibly, incredibly privileged to have some incredible mentors in this business, one of which was Steve Jobs, who was my dad’s best friend and was very much — |  | kara swisher |  | Yeah, people don’t know that. They have very similar backgrounds in a lot of ways. |  | david ellison |  | They do, they do. And Steve was very kind to me. Actually, there’s this story with Skydance that — a meeting I had with him that very much changed the trajectory of the company. When we were first starting Skydance, I asked Steve to pitch him the company. And Steve was very kind. He said, fly up here tomorrow. And I pitched him the company. And he looked at me and said, I don’t think this will work. And I asked him why. And he talked about Pixar. He’s like, I want you to come back up here and talk about how you guys are going to aspire to make movies and tell stories better than anybody else, because he’s like, because that’s what we did at Pixar. |  | kara swisher |  | What was your pitch? Was it more about financing and — |  | david ellison |  | It was much more about financing. It was much more around the franchises that we were going to become a part of. And Steve’s point was, if the movie’s not good, it doesn’t matter that it’s a sequel to a franchise. People still won’t go. And he looked at me at Pixar and talked a lot about the golden age of cinema and the Walt Disney system and how free agency was ultimately created when Walt didn’t really take care of all of the talent at that period of time. And what Steve basically did was he recruited the most talented artists in the world to work at Pixar. They were all partners in the company on top of being filmmakers. And they aimed incredibly high creatively and had a track record and a run that is still, to this day, unprecedented. They did that by aiming high and never stopping work on a movie until they thought it was ready to be released. |  | kara swisher |  | Right. So the Ellison family is a major investor in Skydance, correct? Is your dad- - |  | david ellison |  | Correct. |  | kara swisher |  | — involved in the business? |  | david ellison |  | Yeah, no, my family is the largest shareholder in the business. Tencent, CJ Entertainment and RedBird Capital Partners are also partners in Skydance. My dad is supportive, but we’ve thankfully built a multibillion dollar business. And I have to address him as you would any other shareholder when it comes to it. He gave me an incredible opportunity by believing in me in the beginning. I could not be more grateful for that. And we definitely talk about work constantly and work together constantly. But he’s been an incredible mentor and guide throughout all of this. |  | kara swisher |  | So I’d love you to discuss the influence of your mother. That’s one thing he actually said. One of the things he said to me, I said, your kids seem really nice. They seem — for growing up so wealthy. And he said, oh, it’s because I didn’t raise them. Their mother did, which I thought it was unusual coming out of his mouth, I’ll be honest with you. But talk about the influence of your mom in this. |  | david ellison |  | God, I don’t have enough words to describe how influential my mom’s been in my life. But he’s correct. My mother did raise me. My parents got divorced when I was three. And I grew up predominantly with my mom. And you know, she did the incredibly impossible job of being a single parent to two kids and really set everything aside to raise me and my sister. |  | kara swisher |  | Mm-hmm, and also love of movies, correct? |  | david ellison |  | Absolutely, my love of movies really helped start with my mom, where one of the things the two of us would do is, we would go to the theater and see anything that came out every weekend that it came out, sometimes maybe a little bit too early. Jokingly, seeing “Terminator 2” at eight was maybe questionable, but. |  | kara swisher |  | Yeah, oh, you don’t know. |  | david ellison |  | But I obviously loved that. |  | kara swisher |  | I took my son to “Sausage Party,” and I consider it my worst parenting mistake of my life. |  | david ellison |  | I went to the preview of that with my sister. I was just dying laughing out loud, but — |  | kara swisher |  | I understand, but you don’t want to go with a 14-year-old. |  | david ellison |  | But yes, we don’t really want — yes — |  | kara swisher |  | No. |  | david ellison |  | That’s like a teenager — you know — |  | kara swisher |  | Yeah. |  | david ellison |  | Yeah. |  | kara swisher |  | He looked over at me, and he said, “Awkward. You’re a terrible parent.” And I’m like, I am. I don’t know what to do at this moment. So let’s keep watching. |  | david ellison |  | Definitely rated R. |  | kara swisher |  | But your mother took you to “Terminator 2,” which was the best “Terminator,” actually. |  | david ellison |  | Agreed, and look, and the thing — you brought up my sister. One of the things — my mom had an incredible VHS collection that I actually still have. She had about 2,000 VHS tapes. And my sister and I would always go into the VHS closet and basically pick a series. And our idea of a great time was just finding a franchise to binge all of in one day. And so, we would watch the “Star Wars” saga from start to finish in a day. We’d watch the “Rocky” films from start to finish in a day. And so really, a lot of my love of cinema and film really came from my childhood with my mom. |  | kara swisher |  | Right, so talk a little bit — the idea of coming into Hollywood, many at first thought you were dumb money, like a lot of people. This is not a new, fresh Hollywood thing. You now, given the success — smart money, but money nonetheless. Talk a little bit about that, that idea of when you show up, they think you’re the dumb rich kid, right, presumably. How did you deal with that? |  | david ellison |  | Put my head down, did the work, personally. And then I believe, above everything, we are a business of people. And you know, I was very fortunate, as I said, to have mentors like Steve Jobs and David v and Skip Brittenham. And I listened and, I think, avoided a lot of mistakes by being able to stand on their shoulders gratefully and really listen to the advice. But then also, I tried to partner and hire at Skydance the smartest people possible. And now, when you look around our senior leadership team, one of the things I am the most proud of is the incredible group of people I get to come to work with every day. |  | kara swisher |  | Yeah, I want to talk a little bit, speaking of something that was harder for you, is Pixar co-founder, John Lasseter. You hired him in 2019 after he left Disney after MeToo complaints. It had got a lot of negative publicity. The Hollywood Reporter quoted a source who said Lasseter, quote, “Was known for grabbing, kissing, making comments about physical attributes.” He’s talked about this. What did you learn from that? And what would you do differently? He’s obviously still there. Talk a little bit about what you learned from that. |  | david ellison |  | I learned a tremendous amount from that. First, I don’t have any regrets about hiring John Lasseter. He has been remarkable to work with. And I could not be more proud of the movies that we’re creating and the artists that we’re working with. |  | kara swisher |  | But you did seem to be dealing with a lot of problems. Women at Skydance apparently were crying when he was appointed. So talk a little bit about how you dealt with that and what you think about the weirdness among some in tech and Hollywood about #MeToo and politics in the workplace. |  | david ellison |  | So what I really learned and what I regret is how I handled it. We did a very, very thorough investigation. And basically, we talked to all of our senior leadership. And Skydance has been a 50-50 company. So from that standpoint, we talked to everybody in leadership. But the way we handled it was not great. |  | kara swisher |  | Why do you mean by that? |  | david ellison |  | The way we announced it out into the world, we should have listened more. We should have talked to more people externally and internally. And I really do believe we could have handled it a lot better. But as I said, I stand by the decision. And I think when you look forward at the work that we’re doing, I hope that the work will be able to speak for what we’re building and how special I really believe it is. |  | kara swisher |  | Right, but such is the work, right? I mean, there is a weariness. I’ve met with so many Hollywood people now that are like, no more #MeToo. And I’m like, I don’t know if you can move along quite so quickly, but it’s definitely been changed, the way things are run in Hollywood. How did you change? |  | david ellison |  | So, as I said, Skydance has been a 50-50 company. |  | kara swisher |  | This is 50 men and women. |  | david ellison |  | That’s correct. From our standpoint, again, trying to answer the question the best I possibly can, which is, really, I regret how we announced it out into the world. I think we could have listened and learned more in terms of everybody that we talked to. But in terms of kind of, our founding ideals and believing in a 50-50 culture and believing in supporting equal rights for all artists, that’s how we believed in and felt since day one. That hasn’t changed. It was the same in 2010 as it is today in terms of our viewpoint on the world. I think what we really didn’t understand was the moment that we were living in. And the way that we handled it, we could have done a much, much better job. And that was a wake up call to me. That was probably my hardest professional experience, was that time period in the beginning of Q1 of 2019. And you know, I have learned a tremendous amount since then and have talked to a tremendous amount of people, both internally and externally. And really, the things that they’ve taught me have made me a better leader. [MUSIC] |  | kara swisher |  | We’ll be back in a minute. If you like this interview and want to hear others, follow us on your favorite podcast app. You’ll be able to catch up on “Sway” episodes you may have missed, like my conversation with Matt Belloni and Ben Smith. And you’ll get new ones delivered directly to you. More with David Ellison after the break. So who do you pattern yourself after? You did say in 2015, you wanted it to be Marvel. What did you mean by that? You don’t have a superhero. “Star Trek” was a franchise. “Terminator” was a franchise. “Top Gun” is a franchise. |  | david ellison |  | So what I meant by that was a company that I tremendously look up to and admire. The qualities of movies that come out of Marvel are A+, pretty consistently. The idea to create an interconnected cinematic universe was transformative and never been done before on the big screen. And one of the thematics that we built Skydance on was the idea of where entertainment is heading, you know, the Gretzky quote of, “Skate to where the puck is going, not to where the puck has been.” And I think Marvel embodied all of those characteristics in terms of constantly delivering quality and constantly delivering something that the audience had never seen before, and doing things that were transformative in the industry. And so, I have nothing but admiration and respect for everything they built. |  | kara swisher |  | So talk about “Terminator.” Now I thought “Old Guard” was fantastic, by the way. I thought that should be a franchise. What a good movie. |  | david ellison |  | We are four weeks out from shooting the second one. |  | kara swisher |  | Oh, great. This is with Charlize Theron, and it’s about an old guard of kickass people. I don’t know how else to put it. How would you describe it? |  | david ellison |  | It is about a group of immortals. And I could not be more excited about the sequel, and very, very proud of the original movie. |  | kara swisher |  | By the way, Marvel’s immortals did not work as well. They did not apply excellence there, as I would say. But what didn’t work with the “Terminator” franchise — this is another franchise I adore. But “Genesis” and “Dark Fate” not work. What do you think went wrong there? |  | david ellison |  | On “Genesis,” I think we needed to make a better movie. The movie made $440 million at the box office, but really underperformed domestically. And from the fan side, we heard and understood that they were not satisfied. And that was something we really took in and took to heart. On “Dark Fate,” I’m proud of the movie. And why it didn’t work has been a constant, basically, discussion and debate. But I do really believe in the movie that we made there. And on “Genesis,” I think we really could have done our jobs better. |  | kara swisher |  | May I give you a fan comment? |  | david ellison |  | Please. |  | kara swisher |  | You can only blow up the world so many times. Ultimately, you’ve got to move to a different story. |  | david ellison |  | Yeah. Well, one of the things we definitely talked about was the fact that we didn’t create enough new, and also that after a couple of series of negative installments, there was a need for a larger reset. |  | kara swisher |  | So let’s move on to streaming. You were very bullish on streaming early and sold a lot of shows into streaming, although you just made “Top Gun,” which is such a theater movie. When you think about the equilibrium of Hollywood, the economic equilibrium, where do you think the next thing is going to be? There’s, obviously, huge amounts of tech people involved. There’s all kinds of issues around Netflix and streaming, Warner Brothers. How do you look at it? I interviewed Bob Iger recently. He thought Disney was too small, even, and that there’s a lot that’s going to change. How do you look at it, as someone who’s selling into this environment? |  | david ellison |  | So look, we are big believers in Netflix, Apple, and Amazon. Obviously, our animation deal is with Apple. Our first look live action deal is with Apple. They have been tremendous partners to us. Amazon has been a remarkable partner to us. We had “The Tomorrow War” with them last year, as well as “Without Remorse,” which were both very, very successful. And similar, as we said, I’m big believers in Netflix and don’t think any of those companies are going anywhere. There are a lot of people, myself included, who believe we’re in the middle of a larger market correction. And while that will create challenges for companies, the companies that we’re talking about are world class and best in class and will be able to navigate that and I believe emerge stronger than ever. Theatrical, people have been talking about its demise for a long period of time. First, they talked about its demise when television came out. People talked about that when the DVD business came about. As people, I believe we enjoy social experiences. And I think people will continue to go to the movies. And I think people are going to continue to have a tremendous amount of choice. |  | kara swisher |  | Sure, but it’s smaller. It continues to be smaller and smaller and smaller. It’s way lower than 2019. |  | david ellison |  | Oh, absolutely. But I think we’re still coming out of the pandemic. And I think we’re going to have to see how the consumer basically evolves and how the marketplace evolves. |  | kara swisher |  | So you’re putting your bets everywhere. You’re just going to assume the tech companies are going to be strong players. |  | david ellison |  | We believe tremendously in the direct to consumer business, absolutely. |  | kara swisher |  | All right, I have a couple more questions about the future of Skydance. You have a deal with Paramount that’s up in June, as you said. Will you renew? |  | david ellison |  | So we signed a deal with Apple that started January of this year, which is a first look deal. But we still have a tremendous relationship with Paramount and a tremendous amount of ongoing business with them. All of the franchises that we’ve worked on, from “Mission Impossible” to “Top Gun,” to “Star Trek,” to “Transformers,” the Tom Clancy universe, we’re all continue making together. And we want to find more to do together as well. So we have a great relationship with Paramount. |  | kara swisher |  | All right, I have a few more questions. Beyond streaming, VR, are you preparing any Web3 or Metaverse things? Or are you just waiting for things to happen? |  | david ellison |  | So we took a big bet in VR five years ago. We acquired a company called the Workshop, and our first game, “Archangel,” was kind of a VR mech shooter, but we were a little early on the market a couple of years ago. And then with “Walking Dead, Saints and Sinners,” the market really arrived. |  | kara swisher |  | Do you think the Metaverse is overhyped? This idea, it’s early. It’s certainly early. |  | david ellison |  | It’s definitely early. But I do think — I’ll never forget personally the reason why I was so excited to get into virtual reality is, when I put on the headset, it was one of the most transformative experiences I’ve ever had in my entire life. The last time I can remember in the interactive space feeling that way was when I was a kid, and “Super Mario Brothers” came out on Nintendo 64. And for the first time, you were inhabiting a three-dimensional world, as opposed to just the kind of flat 2D “Zelda” of going left or right. And really, the ability to immerse yourself into a world that VR offered, we thought, was transformative. There was a lot of stuff to figure out. And the game has now sold several million units. And it has no sign of slowing down. So I think you’re going to see the VR marketplace expand. Zuckerberg has very publicly talked about how many headsets he wants to get into people’s homes. And I do believe that there is going to be a very significant market in terms of augmented reality and virtual reality, particularly as it comes to consumer experiences. We talk in animation, for example, it’s amazing to go to Disneyland and have that experience practically and meet the characters. But with augmented reality, you can now bring those characters into your home. So it’s something that we believe in tremendously. And we have several games that we’re creating in this space. |  | kara swisher |  | Yeah, just so you know who’s going to do it, it’s going to be Apple, not Facebook. |  | david ellison |  | As I said, could not be bigger believers in that company. |  | kara swisher |  | Yeah, they love AR. The love AR over there. So there’s been speculation that Skydance will be acquired. Do you want to be acquired? I mean, being an independent company is tough. You can have great years and then not. |  | david ellison |  | So we are not for sale. Our heads are down, and we’re building the business. Last year, we had an incredibly good year. It was actually the strongest year in the history of the company. And this year is already scheduled to be significantly better. We feel very good about where we are. And we’re very much in building mode, is kind of how we’re thinking about it. |  | kara swisher |  | So what is your end game then? Just let me quote your father. Everything’s for sale. But if not an acquisition, what’s your end game? |  | david ellison |  | I view it as always wanting to create optionality. If the once in a lifetime opportunity came about to do something transformative inside of a large organization, you never want to say never, but that’s not something we’re actively exploring at the moment. We’ve talked about the ability to go public. But again, right now, we’re really kind of heads down, building the business. |  | kara swisher |  | So you’re not exploring any acquisitions at all. You’re not thinking about it. |  | david ellison |  | Not at this moment in time, no. |  | kara swisher |  | OK, I’d be remiss if I didn’t ask about your dad, this news about the Trump phone call that he was involved in. Now you’re in Hollywood, which is very liberal. Do you get impacted by that? I think — you’re not your dad. I’m not going to give you responsibility for what calls your father’s on in his businesses. So, but do you — does that affect your business there in Hollywood? |  | david ellison |  | So, Kara, let me be really clear about a couple of things. One is, as I’m sure you can appreciate, there are more rumors about my father than truth these days. I mean — and while I would never want to speak for anybody in my family, I feel very, very comfortable, and it is very easy to say that everybody in my family believes it was a free and fair election and accepts the results of the election. |  | kara swisher |  | OK. |  | david ellison |  | I am a socially liberal person myself, but you know, want to put that firmly on the record, so that there’s no questions. |  | kara swisher |  | OK, but it doesn’t affect you in your work. I just had a conversation like this with someone else who has a controversial spouse. And it’s like, I’m not that person. |  | david ellison |  | The only thing I — it’s, I can only be myself. I can only let my own actions speak for me. And as it relates to my dad and my family, I love them dearly. There can always be complexities within families. But you know, I love all of them. And obviously, whether there’s any issues, anyone wants to talk about anything, I’m an open book in regards to that and will always talk to anybody about it. |  | kara swisher |  | Let me leave you with the last question. Are you Maverick, Goose or a rooster? |  | david ellison |  | Haha. Can I say aspiring towards Maverick? Is that a fair answer? |  | kara swisher |  | Yeah, that can be. That’s fine. Or do you have another name? |  | david ellison |  | No, no, no call signs on our side, but — |  | kara swisher |  | Mine is Chaos Monkey, after Elon Musk. |  | david ellison |  | That’s fantastic. |  | kara swisher |  | We’ll see how that goes. All right, David, thank you so much. |  | david ellison |  | Thank you. [MUSIC] |  | kara swisher"

In the past two years, the Uvalde school district has hosted at least two active shooter trainings, according to reporting by The Times. One of them was two months ago. Current protocol and best practices say officers must persistently pursue efforts to neutralize a shooter when a shooting is underway. This is true even if only one officer is present. This is without question the right approach. |  | We need to understand why that protocol was not followed in Uvalde. I am still confident the F.B.I.’s focus on training to this standard was right, but I’m less confident in its execution. The officers who responded may have been unprepared for conflict, which can lead to fatal results. Law enforcement officers need to be mentally prepared before they arrive on the scene, so they can respond immediately. |  | Repetitive training builds practice and confidence. Big gatherings for training every few years are more expensive and less effective for muscle memory. Instead, departments should consider more virtual tabletop exercises they can run through in an afternoon. Have officers walk through schools and talk with one another about how they would respond. Require officers to check all their gear before they begin a shift. |  | Last year, active shooters killed 103 people and injured 140 others in 30 states. Five of those attacks were in Texas. Most of our more than 800,000 law enforcement officers in the United States are in small departments. This is not the first time a law enforcement agency has failed in the way it responded. At times, training can become routine and be taken less seriously in any environment, but agencies should be careful to avoid complacency. Are they undertaking the training to check a box? Police department leaders need to tell their officers today what is expected of them and to understand that Americans demand it. |  | We also need to re-evaluate how we advise students and teachers to react when an active shooter enters a school. After Sandy Hook the federal government adopted the run, hide, fight model, which instructs students and teachers to run first if they can, then hide if they must and, finally, fight to survive."

Las luces se atenuaron, como parte de un cierre de emergencia de la escuela que se había puesto en marcha. |  | Según Carrillo, cuando el tirador entró en el edificio de cuarto grado golpeó y pateó la puerta del salón de su hijo Mario, de 10 años, exigiendo que lo dejaran entrar. Pero no pudo abrir la puerta cerrada. |  | Entonces, se dirigió a otros salones. |  | En las aulas conectadas, el aula 111 y el aula 112, un par de profesoras, Eva Mireles e Irma Garcia, estaban proyectando la película Lilo y Stitch mientras los alumnos terminaban sus clases. Una de las profesoras fue a cerrar la puerta para asegurar que no se pudiera acceder desde el pasillo. Pero el tirador ya estaba allí. |  | Miah Cerrillo, de 11 años, vio cómo su maestra retrocedía hacia el aula mientras el atacante la seguía. Primero le disparó a una profesora y luego a la otra. La niña contó que les disparó a muchos alumnos de su clase. Luego fue a la clase contigua y abrió fuego, relató su abuelo, Jose Veloz, de 71 años, quien recuerda el relato de la niña. |  | A continuación, el atacante empezó a disparar de manera salvaje. |  | El aterrador eco de al menos cien disparos retumbó en la escuela mientras los niños de esos salones y las dos profesoras eran abatidos y caían al suelo. Eran las 11:33 de la mañana. |  | No todos los niños que estaban adentro murieron en ese horrible momento. Varios sobrevivieron y se acurrucaron con miedo junto a sus amigos inertes. Uno de los niños cayó sobre el pecho de Miah, que yacía en el suelo, dijo su abuelo. Miah mencionó que por el terror de que volviera a su salón tomó la sangre de una compañera que cayó muerta y se la restregó por todo el cuerpo. Luego se hizo la muerta. |  | Dos minutos después de que el pistolero entró en las aulas conectadas, varios oficiales del Departamento de Policía de Uvalde entraron corriendo a la escuela. Un par de oficiales se acercó a la puerta cerrada de los salones; se oían disparos en el interior.

But it has been willing to engage diplomatically, has repeatedly championed the inviolability of state borders and is not averse to self-interested compromise over issues like trade and climate change. Its rhetoric over Taiwan has been little more than saber-rattling and appears restrained compared to how the United States has historically treated Latin America. |  | Advocates of a new Cold War with China will surely roll their eyes at these assertions. They will say that China has wriggled out of trade commitments, repeatedly violated agreements on climate, used espionage to steal intellectual property, and is building a military designed to inflict harm on the United States and its allies. |  | But it is logical for an emerging great power like China to make plans for its defense, including potential conflict with the United States. It’s also worth remembering that China is deeply intertwined with the U.S. and global economy. It holds more than a trillion dollars’ worth of American debt in the form of U.S. Treasury securities, benefits from the cumulative effect of U.S. investment in China and needs access to foreign markets. All of these realities shape its behavior just as much as the possibility of a future confrontation with the United States. Russia, by contrast, is constrained only by how far Mr. Putin is willing to go. |  | Rather than cast China as our next great enemy, American security would be better served by the realization that Russia’s behavior only highlights the ways that China and the United States remain bound to each other despite their tensions. We should nurture rather than endanger these ties, which are crucial for both countries to remain prosperous, stable and secure. We should also not allow our dislike of China’s domestic system to be the basis of how we engage a country whose centrality to the global system is second only to ours. |  | It’s rarely wise to take on two adversaries at once. Mr. Biden should find new ways to work with China, rather than trying to coerce it to be different. He should take bold steps to tone down the rhetoric, such as lifting Trump-era tariffs on Chinese goods in return for Beijing’s reduced support for Putin. Otherwise, he will miss an opportunity to be a savvy, strategic president rather than one who fights with China at every turn."

That decision is a direct result of a lawsuit in Illinois, a demonstration that strong privacy laws in a single state can have nationwide ramifications. |  | The Biometric Information Privacy Act of Illinois sets strict limits on the collection and distribution of personal biometric data, like fingerprints and iris and face scans. The Illinois law is considered among the nation’s strongest, because it limits how much data is collected, requires consumers’ consent and empowers them to sue the companies directly, a right typically limited to the states themselves. While it applies only to Illinois residents, the Clearview case, brought in 2020 by the American Civil Liberties Union, shows that effective statutes can help bring some of Big Tech’s more invasive practices to heel. |  | Technology companies are in a feverish race to develop reliable means to automate the identification of people through facial scans, thumbprints, palm prints and other personal biometric data. The data is considered particularly valuable because unlike, say, credit card info or home addresses, it cannot be changed. But as these data companies profit by deploying the technology to police departments, federal agencies and a host of private entities, consumers are left with no real guarantees that their personal information is protected. |  | Facial recognition software, in particular, has been shown to fail too often at identifying people of color, leading in some cases to wrongful arrests and concerns that the software could put up additional barriers to people seeking jobs, unemployment benefits or home loans."

The feeling is mutual among activists, many of whom believe the R.N.C. did not do enough to back Mr. Trump’s challenge. |  | The Republican National Committee’s involvement is part of a return to widespread election-work organizing. For nearly 30 years, the committee was limited in some operations by a consent decree after Democrats accused party officials in New Jersey of hiring off-duty police officers and posting signs intended to scare Black and Latino people away from voting.

A wide range of drones has helped the Ukrainian Army punch above its weight on the battlefield, and the footage of attacks against ships and troops, tanks and helicopters has given Ukraine an easily shareable stream of videos for the global information war. |  | “What we are seeing now is a proliferation of images and videos put out by Ukraine and its allies, which are meant to depict power and precision,” John Kaag, a philosophy professor and co-author of a book on drone warfare, told me. |  | Drones carry their own moral hazards, as recent Times investigations into civilian deaths have shown. “What a video surveillance can reveal is that a target was hit or not hit,” Dr. Kaag said. “What it can never reveal is the legitimacy of that particular target.” Little wonder that drone operators are also vulnerable to the moral injury and post-traumatic stress that can affect troops on the ground. |  | What’s more, watching drone footage can be desensitizing, and moral injury from the battlefield can be contagious to spectators. It’s easy to cheer the destruction of yet another Russian tank and forget that the crew members being incinerated in the dramatic explosion are someone’s sons, possibly conscripted into a conflict beyond their control. |  | Also lost in the slew of drone footage coming out of Ukraine is the inability of outsiders to assess their authenticity and the larger situation just outside the drone’s field of view. Misinformation is its own currency in war. But what is clear is that drones have come of age and will be a permanent fixture in future conflicts. |  | We have been seeking to master unmanned flight nearly as long as planes have flown. Early drones took to the skies as early as World War I. More modern drones have been used by the United States since the Vietnam War. But it was only after the Sept. 11 attacks that modern combat drones began to project military power, after the C.I.A. first strapped a missile on Predator No. 3034 and flew it over Afghanistan in 2001. And for a short time, the United States was essentially the world’s lone drone superpower. |  | Since then, the world’s combatants have rushed to send their own drones aloft. |  | Conflicts in the years since have seen more and more drones making war, including ISIS fighters doing battle in Iraq and Syria, Turkish troops surveilling and striking fighters in Kurdistan, an assassination attempt in Venezuela and rebels in Yemen launching attacks against Saudi infrastructure."

After accumulating more than 70 panels and three stacks of batteries, she has gotten her family’s monthly bill down to just $26. |  | Ms. Nakagawa is not alone. Nearly a third of Hawaii’s single-family houses have rooftop solar panels — more than twice the percentage in California — and officials expect many more homes to add panels and batteries in the coming years. |  | Even before energy prices surged globally this year, homeowners, elected leaders and energy executives in Hawaii had decided that rooftop solar panels were one of the best ways to meet demand for energy and tame the state’s high power costs. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has only strengthened the state’s embrace of renewable energy. Electricity rates in Hawaii jumped 34 percent in April from a year earlier because many of its power plants burn oil, about a third of which came from Russia last year. |  | While Hawaii faces unique challenges, the state’s reliance on solar carries lessons for other states and countries looking to fight climate change and bring down energy costs. The state has increased the use of renewable energy in large part by getting electric utilities to accept rooftop solar rather than fight it, as energy companies in California, Florida and other states have been doing."

Paintings go out into the world by themselves, to be seen in isolation, but they also should be seen together, in the way they were made, in series.” |  | Over the last decade the reception of Wool’s work, along with that of several of his peers, has been conditioned by the stratospheric prices his paintings have commanded in the hard-charging market — in 2015 one sold for almost $30 million at Sotheby’s, and even with a recent cooling in his auction standing, as figuration has taken center stage, major paintings still change hands for multiple millions. Wool, 67, mostly demurs on questions about the effect market machinations can have on an artist’s life and work, saying that addressing it inevitably risks making one sound disingenuously ungrateful for success. |  | But he adds: “It sometimes feels not only like you’re in a car that you’re not driving. It feels as if you’re tied up in the back of the car and no one is even telling you where you’re going.” For that reason and others, he said, the pandemic — which he and his wife, the painter Charline von Heyl, spent mostly by themselves in Marfa, Texas, where they began living and working off and on in 2007 — ended up being a pivotal reset."

Can an eponymous fragrance be far in the offing? (“Se-daring. For the imp in you.”) |  | Depending on your point of view, this onslaught — particularly given that Sedaris likes to revisit scenarios that he’s already written about — may strike you as either overgenerous or delightful. I fall into the latter camp, partly because “retention” is merely a word to me, and partly because I hold that the essential trait of a literary classic is that it is so textured that one can reread it and usually find something new. |  | Sedaris’s last collection, “Calypso,” practically destroyed me. Between the accounts of his troubled sister Tiffany, who died by suicide, and those of his father, who was begrudging and abusive to Sedaris throughout his life, I welled with tears four times. I chuckled frequently and projectile-laughed once. Most contemporary comic essayists have honed their powers of self-deprecation into excoriating, and sometimes exhausting, laser beams, but Sedaris is often willing to apply this same level of scrutiny to other people as well — and to do it without being nasty. For readers this can be eye-widening, and sometimes exciting, and surely is part of what makes Sedaris’s work such a sneaky, subversive thrill. Whether he’s detailing how his father, Lou, liked to eat food that he’d hidden around the house until it rotted, or he’s going off on homeless people in Portland, Sedaris dispenses with the parameters of You Can’t Say That like a tween boy scorching ants with a magnifying glass. |  | In my favorite type of Sedaris essay — the kind I’ll keep rereading — the author takes an unusual or taboo topic, such as death or incontinence, and then shows us how a group of flawed characters including himself circle around that topic; but then, in the last paragraph or two, he unleashes a blast of tenderness or humanity that catches you off guard. Take the new collection’s offering “Hurricane Season,” which, mostly set at Sedaris and his boyfriend Hugh’s beach houses in North Carolina, is about how spending time with our families can cause us to re-examine our relationships with our partners. Sedaris knows that his siblings are sometimes put off by Hugh: Each of them, at some point, has asked Sedaris, “What is his problem?” Hugh, the guardian of manners and tradition among the wild-eyed and heathen Sedarii, is not afraid to snap or dole out punishment when one of them wears a down coat to the dinner table, or calls his chairs rickety, or feeds candy to ants. (Sedaris, the candyman, writes, “Gretchen patted my hand. ‘Don’t listen to Hugh. He doesn’t know [expletive] about being an ant.’”) But by essay’s end we find Hugh, after one of his and Sedaris’s houses is all but destroyed by Hurricane Florence, holed up in the bedroom, sobbing, his face in his hands, his shoulders quaking. We learn that three of the houses Hugh grew up in had also been destroyed. In such moments, Sedaris’s family has no jurisdiction: “They see me getting scolded from time to time, getting locked out of my own house, but where are they in the darkening rooms when a close friend dies or rebels storm the embassy? When the wind picks up and the floodwaters rise? When you realize you’d give anything to make that other person stop hurting, if only so he can tear your head off again?”"

Here are live updates. |  | The embargo, if approved, would come at a heavy economic cost for the E.U., which gets about 27 percent of its crude oil imports from Russia and a higher share of its oil products. Member states have been spending around $23 billion each month on Russian crude since the war started and oil prices surged. The embargo would bruise Russia, but the damage would be slow until restrictions kick in. |  | And it has political stakes as well. Negotiators were forced to capitulate to Hungary’s demand that it be indefinitely exempted from the measure. Prime Minister Viktor Orban benefits from the cheap energy — and his ties to the Kremlin.

Each photo is a precious moment that, when captured by my iPhone’s camera, I’m positive I will cherish forever. But I don’t. I rarely revisit these digital photos. |  | Thankfully, I have a solution. |  | For each of the past six years, I’ve made a photo book—yes, an actual, physical book—with 100 to 200 photos of my children from the previous year. These photo books sit on a shelf 5 feet away from my desk. Every so often I pull one off the shelf, peruse it, remember, and smile. I cannot overstate how much more accessible these memories feel in a book that I can reach for and physically touch compared with accessing them on some illusory entity called an “iCloud.” |  | These books are powerful and meaningful. No longer are these beloved memories of my children lost in a sea of photos too vast for me to earnestly explore. They are right here, in my hand. I turn the page, and I see more. There’s something about the tactile sensation and in-real-life permanence of a book. I relive the memories as I flip through. |  | Of course, this is not a new idea. For generations, photo albums—stuffed with actual printed photographs protected by plastic sleeves—were commonplace for millions of American families. After my father and I went on a trip to Japan in 2004, I printed out a bunch of photos at the local drugstore and put them in a photo album that I gave to him as a gift—a gesture that now feels almost Paleolithic. But it doesn’t have to. |  | Today, making photo books using online services is relatively easy and inexpensive. It takes a bit of time—but trust me, you can do it. Anyone can. |  | Wirecutter has spent years testing photo book services. I’ve always used Shutterfly—which was Wirecutter’s pick for several years—and have found it intuitive to use. But our picks have evolved, and we now recommend Mixbook. Our experts say: “Mixbook offers the best photo-book-building experience, modern design options, and vibrant, color-accurate photo quality. The service also offers great customer service and an impressively powerful app.” And Walmart is our budget pick. I plan to try both in the future. |  | The “Elle and Miles 2021” book that I made on Shutterfly feels like a great value—less than $75 for a hardcover 11-by-14-inch book including shipping. The sentimental-value-to-dollars-spent ratio ranks among the highest of anything I own. (Bonus: They make great and relatively affordable gifts for grandparents!) |  | So how does it work? When I made my 2021 book, I didn’t scour all 10,703 photos from the year looking for the 100 absolute best. Instead, I went to my desktop PC (where all of my iPhone photos are automatically downloaded via iCloud) and zipped through photos on the big screen. I wasn’t seeking perfection or comprehensiveness, simply a good selection that more or less represented the year. |  | I limit myself to 24 pages of photos—a two-page spread for each month of the year. Books can be shorter or longer (though the additional pages cost extra), but I find that a two-page spread for each month is a fine limit. There’s power in finitude. Some pages will get just a single great photo. Others, I’ll put 20 thumbnails on. |  | As I go through photos on my PC, I batch-upload them to Shutterfly a month at a time. So I find 30-ish pretty-good photos from, say, January, picking them in about five minutes. I drag and drop them onto Shutterfly’s site and hit Upload, knowing that not all of them will make it into the book. Then I pick (almost at random) one of Shutterfly’s existing layout templates. For January I pick a 4-by-3 grid for one page and a giant one-spot for the facing page. From my short list of 30-ish photos, I drag and drop 13 onto the pages, one into each slot. It’s beyond simple. |  | Here’s that spread in the book: |  | I then repeat this for the other 11 months. The whole exercise takes two or three sittings of maybe an hour each. The resulting book is something I will revisit and treasure for decades. |  | This is Shutterfly’s “standard binding” on an 11-by-14-inch hardcover photo book in the Simply Modern style. The bindings on all of my books have held up very well—even when my less-than-gentle kids flip through them. Photo: Ben Frumin Shutterfly has hundreds of page templates that you can drag and drop photos into. They come in all sorts of designs—from a single photo surrounded by lots of white space to a 5-by-5-inch grid that allows 25 photos on a page.

The bindings on all of my books have held up very well—even when my less-than-gentle kids flip through them. Photo: Ben Frumin |  | A related recommendation: On the opening pages of each annual photo book, I write a little rat-a-tat-tat list for each of my kids (it’s not part of Shutterfly’s standard template, but I just add my own lightly formatted text box) with this rubric: |  | “In 2021, Elle … |  | … learned to ___. |  | … loved ___. |  | … didn’t much care for ___.” |  | I list 10 or 20 things in each line. It takes just a few minutes for my wife and me to put it together. And while in 2019 I’m sure that we thought we’d always remember that our son loved broccoli and getting his toenails painted, and that our daughter learned how to write her name and tell Alexa what to do, I assure you that a mere three years later I would have forgotten these details and/or when they happened without committing them to print. I hope and trust that when I peruse these books in the future—be it three or 30 years from now—they’ll remind me of the good old days and make me smile. |  | This article was edited by Erica Ogg and Jason Chen."

They have already cut off Russian banks from global financial networks, frozen Russian assets and sent advanced weaponry to Ukraine. |  | After weeks of intense wrangling, E.U. leaders meeting in Brussels endorsed an embargo on Russian oil delivered by tankers, the primary method, with commitments to reduce imports by pipeline, according to a draft agreement seen by The New York Times. The deal was announced in a late-night tweet by Charles Michel, president of the European Council, though many details remain to be hashed out. |  | The endorsement came as a multipronged Kremlin assault closed in on the easternmost Ukrainian-controlled city, Sievierodonetsk. Russian forces continued their pattern of bombarding cities and towns, including civilian areas, reducing them to depopulated wastelands before attempting to seize control. |  | Image A damaged street corner in the city of Sievierodonetsk, in Ukraine’s eastern Donetsk region, last week. Credit... Finbarr O'Reilly for The New York Times |  | At the same time, Ukraine’s military mounted a counteroffensive to retake the strategic southern city of Kherson. And a car bombing in another Russian-held city, Melitopol, hinted at the kind of fierce resistance the occupiers may face. |  | President Vladimir V. Putin’s war machinery is financed by Russia’s sales of crude and refined petroleum and natural gas, which account for most of the country’s export revenue, collected primarily by state-controlled energy companies. With the war driving up prices, the European Union countries alone have been paying $23 billion a month for Russian oil. |  | Analysts say that Russia, offering discounts compared to the prices on world markets, will continue to find some buyers for its oil, but that sales volume and profits are likely to drop significantly once the embargo takes effect. |  | Europe relies heavily on Russian fuels — 27 percent of the crude oil imported to the European Union comes from Russia — and while E.U. countries are scrambling for alternatives, officials have warned that the financial cost to them will be high. Other sources are expected to be more expensive, if they can be arranged; gas and oil shortages are a real possibility. |  | The debate over an oil embargo has also exposed the potential vulnerability of the European bloc, just as Sweden’s and Finland’s requests to join NATO have shown fractures within that alliance. Diplomats express confidence that such differences can be resolved, but they offer reminders that the unity the United States and its allies have shown so far in opposing Russia is not guaranteed. |  | Hungary’s strongman leader, Viktor Orban, whose country depends more than Western Europe on Russian energy, had held up any agreement on an oil embargo, calling it an “atomic bomb” to the Hungarian economy. |  | The dispute illustrates how the E.U. practice of requiring unanimity among the 27 member nations for major decisions can become a weakness — particularly if Mr. Orban, who has a friendly relationship with Mr. Putin, is called on to take further steps to isolate Russia. |  | Image Prime Minister Viktor Orban of Hungary listening to a reporter’s question as he arrives for the European Union leaders summit meeting in Brussels on Monday. Credit... Johanna Geron/Reuters |  | The limited embargo that European leaders endorsed was tailored to win Mr. Orban’s support. Prohibiting Russian oil deliveries aboard tankers would eliminate two-thirds of E.U. imports, while having no effect on Hungary, a landlocked nation. Arriving at the E.U. summit meeting on Monday, Mr. Orban said of the pipeline exemption, “It’s a good approach.” |  | Slovakia, the Czech Republic and Germany, which also receive Russian oil by pipeline, were expected to commit to weaning themselves from that source; Hungary is not expected to give any such assurance. |  | In NATO, which also operates by consensus, Turkey has blocked the admission of Finland and Sweden, which have been sufficiently alarmed by Russia’s war on Ukraine to abandon their long-held neutrality. Western diplomats predict that President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey, who has been as contentious a partner to NATO as Mr. Orban has been to the European Union, will wring concessions from the allies but ultimately accede. |  | On the battlefields of the eastern Donbas region, where Russia is focused on seizing more territory, the most intense combat is around the battered, adjacent cities of Sievierodonetsk and Lysychansk, among the most important remaining pockets of Ukrainian control. After weeks of shelling, Russian forces have fought their way into “the northeastern and southeastern outskirts” of Sievierodonetsk, the Ukrainian defense ministry said in a statement, adding that Russia had funneled still more war matériel from Russia into the Donbas. |  | Fighting across Donbas reached “maximum intensity,” said Col. Oleksandr Motuzyanyk, the defense ministry spokesman. He added, “Russian invaders shelled the entire front line, trying to hit our deep defensive positions with artillery fire.” |  | Amid reports of Russian war crimes against civilians, Ukraine’s deputy prime minister, Iryna Vereshchuk, issued a call to residents of Russian-occupied territory to flee however they can to Ukrainian-controlled areas, as millions already have. It is hard and dangerous, she conceded, but “ultimately, it is a question of your safety and that of your children.” |  | Image The body of a man killed by a Russian rocket attack while in his apartment building in the city of Sievierodonetsk in Ukraine’s eastern Donetsk region last week.

Finbarr O'Reilly for The New York Times |  | A French journalist was killed on Monday near Lysychansk when a shell exploded near the evacuation bus he was riding in, according to Ukrainian and French officials, and his employer, the television news channel BFM TV. The journalist, Frédéric Leclerc-Imhoff, suffered a lethal shrapnel wound to the neck, said Serhiy Haidai, the Ukrainian governor of the Luhansk region, who said the shell was fired by Russian forces. |  | At least seven other journalists have been killed while covering the conflict, according to Reporters Without Borders. |  | The sheer weight of Russia’s military and the brutality of its tactics have yielded territorial gains in the east, but it has suffered heavy losses, and Western analysts say it is running short of ready resources. |  | “Russia has likely suffered devastating losses amongst its mid and junior ranking officers,” the British defense ministry said on Monday in the latest intelligence update it has made public. Battalions that the Russians are cobbling together “from survivors of multiple units are likely to be less effective.” |  | Perhaps most ominous for Moscow, the British cited “multiple credible reports of localized mutinies amongst Russia’s forces.” |  | Hoping to spread Russian forces thinner than they already are, Ukraine over the weekend launched a counteroffensive more than 300 miles away from Sievierodonetsk, aimed at retaking Kherson, a strategic port on the lower Dnipro River in south-central Ukraine. It was the first major city to fall to the Russians, less than a week after the invasion. |  | Image Russian troops guarding an entrance of the Kakhovka Hydroelectric Station on the Dnipro River in the Kherson region of southern Ukraine on Friday. Credit... Associated Press |  | “The Ukrainian counterattack does not appear likely to retake substantial territory in the near term,” the Institute for the Study of War in Washington said in an assessment released on Sunday, but it will disrupt Russian operations across the south, “and potentially force Russia to deploy reinforcements to the Kherson region, which is predominantly held by substandard units.” |  | In Melitopol, the Kremlin-appointed regional administration said a car bombing had injured two aid workers and called it “a terrorist attack aimed at destabilizing the peaceful life of the city.” People have protested the occupation in Melitopol, where Russian forces have kidnapped local officials and replaced them. |  | Ivan Fyodorov, the mayor of Melitopol — who was abducted by Russian forces and then returned to Ukraine in a prisoner swap — said he did not know who was responsible for the bombing, but predicted that “the ground will burn” in Melitopol until Russians leave the city. |  | Russian forces have held onto most of the areas they conquered in the south early in the war. But one band of fighters held out for weeks in a steel mill complex in the southern city of Mariupol, tying down significant Russian forces before the survivors surrendered this month. |  | And in the first weeks of the war, Russian offensives in the north aimed at Kyiv, the capital, and Kharkiv, the second-largest city, became hopelessly bogged down. Moscow gave up on those campaigns, at least temporarily, to concentrate on Donbas, and Ukrainians have retaken some of the lost territory. |  | The failure of those offensives and the resistance in Mariupol contributed to a shift in Russian tactics to a slower, more grinding approach, with little apparent concern for civilian casualties or physical destruction. |  | Describing the constant shelling of Sievierodonetsk, President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine said in a video posted online on Sunday night, “They don’t care how many lives they will have to pay.” |  | Matina Stevis-Gridneff reported from Brussels and Richard Pérez-Peña from New York.

nytimes,https://www.nytimes.com/live/2022/05/30/world/covid-19-mandates-vaccine-cases,2022-05-30T00:00:00,"Crossings at land borders, like this one at the Peace Bridge connecting Canada and the United States, do not require negative coronavirus tests. |  | Michelle Fishman calls it the “worst-case scenario that you don’t really think through.” |  | After a three-week vacation in Greece, the 52-year-old hotel art consultant from Miami and her husband took pre-departure coronavirus tests required to fly home from overseas. She tested positive, he did not. |  | Although coronavirus travel restrictions have eased across many parts of the world, the United States still requires all international air passengers to present a negative test taken within one day of departure. And according to guidance issued by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Ms. Fishman should have isolated and delayed travel for 10 days, but she said she had to get home earlier to officiate at a wedding. |  | Instead, she took advantage of a quirk in the rules to head home after five days (the mandatory self-isolation period required by the Greek government) via a “backdoor” — crossing into the United States by land, which does not require a coronavirus test, rather than by air. Because Canada does not require a test for entry, the couple first flew to Toronto and, after spending a night there, Ms. Fishman and her husband drove across the border into Buffalo and caught a flight home. (There is no testing requirement for flying domestically.) |  | “I had zero symptoms, no fever, nothing. I felt fine and when you’re stateside, the C.D.C. says you can end isolation five days after testing positive, so the same rules should apply when I’m traveling,” Ms. Fishman said. “It makes no sense that I can go to a wedding five days after a positive test in Miami, but if I catch the virus when I’m on vacation I can’t fly home. That should be illegal.” |  | It is not clear how many infected people are using backdoor routes to get home, which can also include flying to Mexico and using a land crossing there, because airlines do not require passengers to provide reasons for canceling or changing flights. But strong anecdotal evidence indicates that some travelers — and travel advisers — are sharing suggestions for how to avoid getting stuck. |  | In flying to Toronto, Ms. Fishman said she was following the guidance of a family friend who used a similar backdoor route to get home to Boston when he tested positive in France in April. |  | Asked if she was worried about infecting other passengers on her long journey home from Greece (she tested positive again, on her fifth day), Ms. Fishman pointed to the C.D.C.’s guidance for people who catch the virus in the United States, which says that asymptomatic people or those with symptoms that have resolved within the five-day isolation period can leave their homes. The recommendation is based on the science that the majority of coronavirus transmission occurs early in the course of the illness, the C.D.C. said. |  | “I slept in the same bed as my husband for five nights and he didn’t catch it, so I don’t think I was contagious by the time I took the flight home,” Ms. Fishman said. “I wore a mask the whole time.” |  | The C.D.C. did not say why it has different policies in place for Americans who test positive at home and abroad, but a spokeswoman for the agency reiterated that travelers should follow the 10-day guidance to not travel before boarding a flight to the United States, even if they test negative. The Department of Homeland Security declined to comment on the possibility of travelers using land borders to circumvent the testing requirement for air travel. |  | The United States introduced the testing requirement in January 2021, when fewer than 10 percent of Americans were vaccinated and cases of new infections and hospitalizations were reaching record levels. Now, with higher vaccination rates and less severe cases of the virus, many American travelers, as well as industry representatives, are calling for the requirement to be lifted, arguing that it does little to prevent new variants of the virus from spreading in the United States. |  | “The existence of these workarounds highlights the absurdity of the current inbound testing policy that is nothing short of ineffective,” said Erika Richter, vice president of communications at the American Society of Travel Advisors, a trade organization. “We’re not following the science.” |  | David Freedman, president-elect of the American Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene, is concerned by travelers using this method, warning that infectious people taking a flight or public transportation to a border crossing will put a lot of people who are not up-to-date on their vaccinations at risk, including at airport eateries and other places along the way. |  | “From a public health point of view, the infectious person may be carrying in one of the new variants BA.4 or BA.5 which is more infectious and is not so common yet in the U.S.,” he said. “There may be new enhanced vaccines by the fall and introducing these variants sooner rather than later may be bad.” |  | After testing positive in Stockholm in early April, one American traveler and her wife decided to return to Seattle via Vancouver, because a U.S.-Canada border crossing was relatively close to their home. If she was required to take a test upon arrival at the Vancouver airport, she said, she planned to drive home and isolate there. The woman asked to speak anonymously, because she was afraid of negative repercussions. |  | “We had symptoms for about two weeks before testing positive. By the time we actually tested positive we felt great, with barely any symptoms, so we felt confident to travel,” she said. “Vancouver airport is pretty chill and low-key. If you look healthy, determined and at ease, no one is going to pull you out of a crowd.” |  | Upon arrival, Canadian officials often ask passengers health questions, and some airports, like those in Toronto and Vancouver, may randomly select some passengers to take coronavirus tests before being cleared to leave the airport. |  | The Canadian authorities warn infected people against attempting to transit through Canada, saying that they are not permitted to board flights into the country if they have Covid-19 symptoms or have been infected within 10 days of their departure. Before arriving in Canada, travelers have to fill out a health and travel form on the ArriveCAN app. The form contains a number of questions, including vaccination status and whether a passenger has coronavirus symptoms. |  | “All travelers arriving in Canada are obligated by Canadian law to respond truthfully to all questions,” said Rebecca Purdy, a senior spokeswoman for the Canada Border Services Agency. |  | “Travelers who knowingly travel to Canada with an active Covid-19 infection and who do not disclose this information may face penalties and/or criminal charges and foreign nationals may also be denied entry and/or banned from returning to Canada,” Ms. Purdy said. |  | Mexican authorities did not return requests for comment. U.S. travelers may enter Mexico without testing or quarantine, though they may be subject to health screenings on arrival. |  | Despite the expense of last-minute bookings, the backdoor routes are also being used by people preemptively, to ensure they can travel home on time. |  | Hilary Aranda, 39, a user-experience designer, had just finished a two-week dance tour in Italy when 12 Americans in her group tested positive. To avoid a positive result and the possible headaches involved, she never took a test, instead canceling her flight home to Los Angeles for a flight to Tijuana, Mexico, with layovers in London and Mexico City. She then crossed the land border into San Diego and drove home. The changes to her itinerary set her back more than $2,000. |  | “Everyone around me had Covid and I knew with my luck that if I took the test, it would come out positive and I didn’t want to risk it,” said Ms. Aranda, who wore a mask on her flights. “Looking back, it was kind of a crazy decision and a big schlep, but I had to get back to my life and kids.” |  | Some travelers who are more risk-averse, but still determined to avoid isolation in another country, have been using telemedicine services like Quick MD to obtain “documentation of recovery” that allows people to travel to the United States without having to show a negative test. The option is available to travelers who continue to test positive 10 days after their initial positive test or onset of symptoms, as it can take weeks or even months before some people test negative. |  | During the video or phone consultation with a medical professional authorized to give travel clearance, some travelers have been lying about the date their symptoms started so that they can return home without having to complete the 10-day isolation period. |  | “It was a three-minute consultation, and I just told the doctor that my symptoms started earlier than they did,” said one traveler, who asked to speak anonymously out of fear of getting into trouble with authorities. He had tested positive in London a day before his scheduled flight home to New York, he said, but returned home three days later. |  | “I got my clearance document within an hour it was so easy,” he said. |  | Quick MD did not respond to multiple requests for comment. |  | Ms. Fishman made it back home in time for the wedding and never developed Covid-19 symptoms, although she said she felt exhausted, which she blamed on the stress caused by the ordeal of trying to get back in time. |  | “My chances of catching Covid in Miami are just as high as catching it while I travel so the testing requirement is useless in my opinion,” she said. |  | Travelers contemplating a similar route should be warned that they can be caught out. Ms. Purdy, of the Canadian border services, noted that violating instructions upon entering Canada could lead to up to six months in prison, 750,000 Canadian dollars in fines (around $586,000) or both. |  | Follow New York Times Travel on Instagram, Twitter and Facebook.
